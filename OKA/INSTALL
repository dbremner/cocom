  Better way to install OKA is usage of top COCOM configure &
Makefile (see file INSTALL in the top COCOM directory).

  In any case you need to run configure in the top COCOM directory (in
order to create Makefile for OKA), to build AMMUNITION and SPRUT
(because OKA uses them for its building).  After that we can work with
only OKA (building, installation, and so on).  The OKA Makefile has
additional entries in comparison of the top COCOM Makefile.  These
are:

test - testing OKA and the scheduler of basic blocks
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only OKA

Example of OKA specification is file `SHCEDULE/test.oka'.
