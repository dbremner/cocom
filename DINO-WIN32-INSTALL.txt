  DINO has been ported into Win32 environment.  You can translate it
by Microsoft VC++ 6.0.  To make this, open workplace in the
uppest subdirectory `dinolang', choose `dinolang' as active project,
choose Debug or Release version, and make Build `dinolang.exe'.  The
project dinolang contains all projects for building all Dino
interpriter and COCOM toolset components used for building DINO
interpriter.  After building, all binary and library files will be in
the uppest sub-directory `bin', all object files in sub-directories
with name dino and names of COCOM components (msta, shilka, sprut,
ammunition) of the uppest subdirectory `obj'.  You can move DINO
interpriter dino.exe (placed in the sub-directory `bin') in the any
place convenient for you.  In order to process yacc files, the DINO
sources has already Win32 yacc utility.  You do not need any
manipulation for yacc program.

  If you do not need modify sources of DINO, the better way of DINO
installation is to use install package prepared by InstallShield.  You
can find the package on the same DINO web site.

  You can also use for building DINO the package cygwin
(http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin) as it described in file INSTALL.
