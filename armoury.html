<P>
On passable in the capital United Arabic Emirates international
exhibition of arming IDEX-93, novelty of russia modern weapon - 152-mm
selfpropelled howitzer "MSTA" was presented for the first time.
</P>
<P>This self-propelled gun, not having itself equal amongst foreign
analogues, has spent 40 highexact ammunitions and has struck 38 real
targets on range 15 km.  MSTA was accepted on the arming at 1989
years.  The selfpropelled howitzer is intended for destroying the
tactical nucleus facilities, artillery and mortar batteries, tanks and
other armoured technicians of enemy.  MSTA is made on the caterpillar
carriage, unified with the carriage of tanks T-72 and T-80. Automaton
of charging ensures 7 shots per minute.  Store is 50
projectiles. On IDEX-93 corrected artillery projectile with the lazer
half-active system of aiming was applying for the shooting.  Time of
transition howitzers from the field position and back is from one to
two minutes.

<P>
Installation "MSTA" was created for changing in troops 152-mm
selfpropelled howitzers "Acacia".  Carriage of tanks T-72 and T-80
were used for its creation.  The howitzer was designed at the factory
"UralTransMach" under management of the main constructor Y.V.Tomashev.
On the arms it was accepted at 1989 years.  Issue of MSTA originally
was fulfilled at the factory "UralTransMach" in Ecaterinburg city but
then on plant in Sterlitamack city in Baskiriya.
</P>
<P>
MSTA has unusual for self-propelled guns of such caliber an
arrangement of the machine.  Control branch in nose part of the body,
then a combat branch.  Motor branch settles down in back part of the
body.  Lead wheels also are placed in the back part of body.  The body
of machine completely armoured and protects from the fire of
large-caliber machine guns and splinters of projectiles.
</P>
<P>
For feeding an electroequipment a gas-turbine engine is
installed. The installation is equipped with system of obtaining the
data for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
152-mm howitzer is placed in a tower of big size that does work of a
crew comparatively suitable. High rate of shooting is ensured by the
automatic system transmission and keeping of projectiles. Except it,
there is also special pipeline of transmission of the projectiles from
the soil.
</P>
<P>
Large-caliber antiaircraft gun (caliber 12,7-mm) with aiming range
of shooting 2000 m is on the small tower installed for the
self-defense of the installation and for the struggle with air
targets. Shooting from it can be fulfilled by means of remote control
system from the tower.  For the disguise of howitzers are used also
smoke grenade launchers on the front part of the tower.
</P>
<P>
Except usual types of projectiles traditionally used in Russia for
cannon of this caliber, an installation can use 152-mm a projectile
with lazer aiming "Krasnopol".  Exactly this projectile was
demonstrated in the action on the exhibition of arming on IDEX-93 and
has shown exceedingly high efficiency.  On the international
exhibition of arming, another type of the ammunition (for stating the
radio-hindrances) was demonstrated. These projectiles are intended for
breaking a governing the command points of enemy.
</P>
<P>
Cost of MSTA on the west market of arming is about 1,600.000
dollars.  At present, MSTA is on arming in Russia and some countries
of C.I.S.

<P>
Unique russian artillery system Nona-SVK, combining in itself
characteristics of mortar and howitzers.  Caliber of tapped cannon -
120 mm.  It is entered on the arms with 1990.  Precede model Nona-S
(on the carriage of combat machine of descent BMD-1) by its fire not
once rescued russian commandos in Afghanistan.  Lifted nearly in the
zenith a barrel allowed to decide in mountains such problems, with
which could not manage howitzers and guns.  Carriage of sailing
armored personnel carrier BTR-80 is used as base for the
self-propelled artillery cannon.

<H2><A NAME=OKA>Soviet 420-mm self-propelled mortar "OKA"</a></H2>

<P>
A little known that at 1960 years 420 mm self-propelled mortar Oka
was successfully assayed in firing-field conditions.  It had a barrel
more than 20 m length, made from united stocking up metal, and shot on
range of 45 km.  This world record holder amongst mortars was not
accepted on the arms because of fast developing rockets.  But on the
parade on the Red Square it appeared.  Curiously enough that
specialists in the field of ballistics considered that thin wall
barrel of such length will be bent from the own weight and aiming
shooting from the mortar will be impossible. In practice rule,
designers are right: their suggestion that powder gases will
dynamically "tighten" barrel, are brilliantly justified.

<P>This self-propelled gun, accepted on the arms at sixtieth years, has
closed tower with installed in it 23 mm automatic guns with band
feeding.  Antenna of radioradar is mounted aft, moreover in the field
position its mirror is put on the roof of power branch.  Shilka equal
with tanks on mobility and passability allowed to cover troops on the
march - an efficient fire was fulfilled due to the stabilization
system of shot line and visaing.  Self-propelled gun was successfully
used syrian troops during the war 1973 year on the near east.

<P>
Production in series of installation lasted with 1966 on 1983 years.
The whole was released more than 8000 units.  Installation hitherto
inheres on arming in Russia armies and else more, than in 30 countries
of the world.  Main constructor of installation - N.A.Astrov.
</P>
<P>
Armoured body ensures protection from the bullets and splinters.  It
is divided into three parts: branch of mechanics-driver in the front
part, combat branch in the centre and motor branch in the back part of
the machine.  Crew consists of four persons: commander,
mechanics-driver, operator RLS finding targets and gun-layer.
Mechanics-driver is placed in the machine body, but rest crew members
- in the tower.
</P>
<P>
Except the main engine for ensuring a motion, gas-turbine engine by
the power 80 hp for feeding an radioequipment and drives of aiming was
installed on the machine.
</P>
<P>
Control system of the fire consists of RLS, aiming device, computer
and stabilizers of guns in vertical and horizontal planes. RLS is
capable to find targets on the distance of 20 km and accompany them on
the distance of 18 km.  Optical sight can be used at need.  Shooting
from installation can be fulfilled from place or from the move (on
velocities of 25 km/hour), as well as on escarpments with the
steepness less than 10 degrees.

<P>
On its tactical-technical features this smooth barrel gun has no
analogues in the world.  It is on arming from the end of 80 years.  It
allows to lead a circular fire.  Before the first shot shutter is
opened manually, but hereinafter according to recoil - automatically.
Herewith a firing pin is cocked and shot cartridge case is thrown.
Particularity of the gun is presence of power unit, which ensures a
quick self-moving a gun on the battlefield.  Engine is located on the
right side under the special cover.  Maximum velocity when self-moving
is about 10 km/hour.

Mass of the gun           - 6375 kg
Range of direct shot      - 2000 m
Maximum range of shooting - 12200 m
