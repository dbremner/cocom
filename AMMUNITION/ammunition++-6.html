<P>The compilers often use internal representation which stores source
code positions.  Here package `position' which serves to support
information about source positions of compiled files taking into
account all included files is suggested.</P>
<P>The strategy of the package usage can be follows.  Function `initiate'
of class `positions' is called by the first.  After that function
`start_file' of class `positions' is called when a file is opened for
compilation as source or included file.  Members `line_number' and
`column_number' of variable `current_position' are modified
correspondingly during given file compilation.  The value of
`current_position' can be stored into internal representation for
usage for output messages on the following passes.  Function
`finish_file' of class `positions' is called when a processed file is
closed.  Function `finish' of class `positions' may be called after
all processing a source file.</P>
<P>The package uses packages `vlobject' and `objstack' which use package
`allocate'.  The interface part of the package is file `position.h'.
The implementation part is file `position.cpp'.  The interface contains
the following objects:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Type `position_t'</B><DD><P>is simply `class position' describes a file position.  The
class has the following members:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Public members `line_number', `column_number'</B><DD><P>are source line and column corresponding to given
position.</P>

               `const char *file_name (void)'

returns name of file to which given position belongs.</P>

               `class position *path (void)'

is pointer to another position class object
representing position of a include-clause which caused
immediately given file compilation.</P>

returns number of level of position file inclusion.
The level numbers are started with zero for positions
corresponding non-included files and for positions
which does not correspond to concrete file.</P>

<DT><B>Class `positions'</B><DD><P>The class has not public constructors/destructors.  The class
has the following members:
<DL>
<DT><B>Static const member `no_position'</B><DD><P>has value of type `position_t' has values `line_number',
`column_number' equals to zero or `NULL'.  The value does not

<DT><B>Static member `current'</B><DD><P>has value which is current file position.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

initiates the package.  Value of variable `current' becomes
equal to `no_position'.</P>

           `void finish (void)'

save position in member variable `current' and sets up new
values of members of `current'.  Values of members
`file_name', `line_number', `column_number', and `path'
become equal to the function parameter value, 1, 0, and
pointer to the saved position.  Values of `current' during
different calls of the function must be different (e.g.
different columns or lines), i.e. positions of different
include-clauses must be different.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           `void finish_file (void)'

restores previous value of the member `current', more
exactly sets up the member by position to which the
member `path' refers.</P>

<DT><B>Static public Function `compare'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           `int compare_positions (position_t position_1,

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

compares two positions given by parameters of type
`position_t' and returns -1 (if the first position is less
than the second), 0 (if the first position is equal to the
second) or 1 (if the first position is greater than the
second).  The order of positions is lexicographic.</P>
