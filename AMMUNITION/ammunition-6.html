<P>The compilers often use internal representation which stores source
code positions.  Here package `position' which serves to support
information about source positions of compiled files taking into
account all included files is suggested.</P>
<P>The strategy of the package usage can be follows.  Function
`initiate_positions' is called by the first.  After that function
`start_file_position' is called when a file is opened for compilation
as source or included file.  Members `line_number' and `column_number'
of variable `current_position' are modified correspondingly during
given file compilation.  The value of `current_position' can be stored
into internal representation for usage for output messages on the
following passes.  Function `finish_file_position' is called when a
processed file is closed.  Function `finish_positions' may be called
after all processing a source file.</P>
<P>The package uses packages `vlobject' and `objstack' which use package
`allocate'.  The interface part of the package is file `position.h'.
The implementation part is file `position.c'.  The interface contains
the following external definitions:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Type `position_t'</B><DD>
<P>is structure which describes a file position.  The structure
has the following members:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Member `file_name'</B><DD>
<P>is name of file to which given position belongs.</P>

<DT><B>Members `line_number', `column_number'</B><DD>
<P>are source line and column corresponding to given
position.</P>

<DT><B>Member `path'</B><DD>
<P>is pointer to another position structure representing
position of include-clause which caused immediately
given file compilation.</P>
</DL>
</P>

<DT><B>Variable `no_position'</B><DD>
<P>has value of type `position_t' has members with values equals
to zero or `NULL'.  The value does not correspond to concrete
file position.</P>

<DT><B>Variable `current_position'</B><DD>
<P>has value which is current file position.</P>

<DT><B>Function `initiate_positions'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void initiate_positions (void)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

initiates the package.  Value of variable `current_position'
becomes equal to `no_position'.</P>

<DT><B>Function `finish_position'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void finish_positions (void)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

frees all memory allocated during package work.</P>

<DT><B>Function `position_file_inclusion_level'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `int position_file_inclusion_level (position_t position)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

returns level of inclusion of file of position given as the
function parameter.  The level numbers are started with zero
for positions corresponding non-included files and for
positions which does not correspond to concrete file.</P>

<DT><B>Function `start_file_position'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void start_file_position (const char *file_name)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

copys position structure (by dynamic memory allocation) in
variable `current_position' and sets up new values of members
of `current_position'.  Values of members `file_name',
`line_number', `column_number', and `path' become equal to the
function parameter value, 1, 0, and pointer to the copied
structure.  Values of `current_position' during different
calls of the function must be different (e.g.  different
columns or lines), i.e. positions of different include-clauses
must be different.</P>

<DT><B>Function `finish_file_position'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void finish_file_position (void)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

recovers previous value of variable `current_position', more
exactly sets up the variable by structure to which the
variable member `path' refers.</P>

<DT><B>Function `compare_positions'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `int compare_positions (position_t position_1,
                                position_t position_2)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

compares two positions given by parameters of type
`position_t' and returns -1 (if the first position is less
than the second), 0 (if the first position is equal to the
second) or 1 (if the first position is greater than the
second).  The order of positions is lexicographic.</P>
