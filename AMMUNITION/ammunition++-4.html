<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Package for work with stacks of objects</A></H2>

<P>The package `objstack' is based on package `allocate' and implements
efficient work with stacks of objects (OS).  Work with the object on
the stack top is analogous to one with a variable length object.  One
motivation for the package is the problem of growing char strings in
symbol tables.  Memory for OS is allocated by segments.  A segment may
contain more one objects.  The most recently allocated segment
contains object on the top of OS.  If there is not sufficient free
memory for the top object than new segment is created and the top
object is transferred into the new segment, i.e. there is not any
memory reallocation.  Therefore the top object may change its address.
But other objects never change address.
<P>The package uses package `allocate'.  The interface part of the
package is file `objstack.h'.  Defining macro `NDEBUG' (e.g.  by
option `-D' in C++ compiler command line) before inclusion of the
interface file disables fixing some internal errors and errors of
usage of the package.  The implementation part is file `objstack.cpp'.
The interface contains the following objects:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Type `os_t'</B><DD><P>describes a descriptor of stack of objects.  The type is
simply synonym of `class os'.  All work with stack of objects
is executed through the descriptors.  It should remember that
work with the stack through several descriptors is not safe.
<P>
<DT><B>Macro `OS_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_LENGTH'</B><DD><P>has value which is default size of memory segments which will
be allocated for OS when the stack is created (with not given
initial segment size).  This is also minimal size of all
segments.  Original value of the macros is equal to 512.  This
macro can be redefined in C++ compiler command line or with
the aid of directive `#undef' before including the interface
file.
<P>
<DT><B>Class `os'</B><DD><P>The class contains the following functions:

<DT><B>Public constructor `os'</B><DD><P>

           `os (size_t initial_segment_length

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

creates OS which contains the single zero length object.
Minimum size of memory segments which will be allocated for
OS is given as the parameter.  If the parameter is absent
the allocated memory segments length is equal to
`OS_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_LENGTH'.  But in any case the segment
length is always not less than maximum alignment.

           `~os (void)'

memory used by the OS.

           `void empty (void)'

is used for removing all objects on OS and freeing all
memory allocated for OS except for the first segment.

           `void top_finish (void)'

creates new variable length object with initial zero length
on the top of OS of given descriptor.  The work (analogous
to one with variable length object) with object which was
on the top of OS is finished, i.e. the object will never
more change address.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

           `void top_nullify (void)'

makes that length of variable length object on the top of
OS of given descriptor will be equal to zero.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           `size_t top_length (os)'

returns current length of variable length object on the top of
OS of given descriptor.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

return pointer to correspondingly the first, the last byte
of variable length object on the top of OS of given
descriptor, and pointer to the last byte plus one.
Remember that the top object may change own place after any
addition.

<DT><B>Public function `top_shorten'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           `void top_shorten (size_t n)'

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

removes n bytes from the end of variable length object on
the top of OS of given descriptor.  The top variable length
object is nullified if its length is less than n.
<P>
<DT><B>Public function `top_expand'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           `void top_expand (size_t length)'
           
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

increases length of variable length object on the top of OS
of given descriptor on number of bytes given as the
parameter.  The values of bytes added to the end of
variable length object on the top of OS will be not
defined.

<DT><B>Public function `top_add_byte'</B><DD><P>

adds byte given as the parameter to the end of variable
length object on the top of OS of given descriptor.

           `void top_add_memory (void *str, size_t length)'

adds memory starting with address given as the first
parameter and with length given as the second parameter to
the end of variable length object on the top of OS of given
descriptor.

<DT><B>Public function `top_add_string'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

           `void top_add_string (const char *str)'

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

adds C++ string (with end marker 0) given as the parameter
to the end of variable length string on the top of OS of
the descriptor.  Before the addition the macro deletes last
character of the top variable length object.  The last
character is suggested to be C++ string end marker 0.
