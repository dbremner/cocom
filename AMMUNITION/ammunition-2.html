<P>Developing modern compilers it is necessary to avoid arbitrary limits
on the length or number of any data structure by allocating all data
structures dynamically.  Here the package `allocate' which implements
allocation and freeing memory with automatic fixing allocation errors
is suggested.</P>
<P>The package automatically calls action on situation `no memory'.  The
action never returns control back because after calling function which
processes allocation error the function `abort' is always called.
Therefore the function which processes allocation error should not
return control back.</P>
<P>The interface part of the package is file `allocate.h'.  Defining
macro `NDEBUG' (e.g. by option `-D' in C compiler command line) before
the package macros usage disables fixing some internal errors and
errors of usage of the package.  The implementation part is file
`allocate.c'.  The interface contains the following external
definitions and macros:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Function `change_allocation_error_function'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void change_allocation_error_function
              (void (*error_function) (void))) (void)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is used for changing up action on the situation `no memory'.
The function also returns former function which was early
action on the situation `no memory'.</P>

<DT><B>Function `default_allocation_error_function'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void default_allocation_error_function (void)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is default action of the package on the situation `no memory'.
This action consists of output message `*** no memory ***' to
standard error stream and calling function `exit' with code
equals to 1.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `MALLOC'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `MALLOC(ptr, size)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is analogous to ANSI C library function `malloc'.  But the
macro has two parameters.  The first is pointer variable which
is set up by address of allocated memory.  The second is size
of needed memory.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `CALLOC'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `CALLOC(ptr, nel, size)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is analogous to ANSI C library function `calloc'.  But the
macro has three parameters.  The first is pointer variable
which is set up by address of allocated memory.  The last two
parameters have the same sense as in standard function
`calloc'.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `FREE'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `FREE(ptr)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is analogous to ANSI C library function `free' but can accept
nil pointer value.  In this case macro does nothing.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `REALLOC'</B><DD>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `REALLOC(new, old, size)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is analogous to ANSI C library function `realloc' but has
three parameters.  The first parameter is variable which is
set up by new address of reallocated memory.  The second is
old address of reallocated memory.  And third is new size of
reallocated memory.</P>
