  Better way to install AMMUNITION is usage of top COCOM configure &
Makefile (see file INSTALL in the top COCOM directory).

  In any case you need to run configure in the top COCOM directory in
order to create Makefile for AMMUNITION.  After that we can work with
only AMMUNITION packages (building, installation, and so on).  The
AMMUNITION Makefile has additional entries in comparison of the top
COCOM Makefile.  These are:

test - tesing packages
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only AMMUNITION
