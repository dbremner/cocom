<P>The package `objstack' is based on package `allocate' and implements
efficient work with stacks of objects (OS).  Work with the object on
the stack top is analogous to one with a variable length object.  One
motivation for the package is the problem of growing char strings in
symbol tables.  Memory for OS is allocated by segments.  A segment may
contain more one objects.  The most recently allocated segment
contains object on the top of OS.  If there is not sufficient free
memory for the top object than new segment is created and the top
object is transferred into the new segment, i.e. there is not any
memory reallocation.  Therefore the top object may change its address.
But other objects never change address.</P>
<P>Because arguments of all macros which return a result
(`OS_TOP_LENGTH', `OS_TOP_BEGIN', `OS_TOP_BOUND', and `OS_TOP_END')
may be evaluated many times no side-effects should be in the
arguments.</P>
<P>The package uses package `allocate'.  The interface part of the
package is file `objstack.h'.  Defining macro `NDEBUG' (e.g.  by
option `-D' in C compiler command line) before the package macros
usage disables fixing some internal errors and errors of usage of the
package.  The implementation part is file `objstack.c'.  The interface
contains the following definitions and macros:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Type `os_t'</B><DD><P>describes a descriptor of stack of objects.  All work with
stack of objects is executed by the following macros through
the descriptors.  Structure (implementation) of this type is
not needed for using stack of objects.  But it should remember
that work with the stack through several descriptors is not
safe.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_LENGTH'</B><DD><P>has value which is default size of memory segments which will
be allocated for OS when the stack is created (with zero
initial segment size).  This is also minimal size of all
segments.  Original value of the macros is equal to 512.  This
macro can be redefined in C compiler command line or with the
aid of directive `#undef' before any using the package
macros.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_CREATE'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_CREATE(os, initial_segment_length)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

creates OS which contains the single zero length object.  OS
descriptor is given as the first macro parameter.  Minimum
size of memory segments which will be allocated for OS is
given as the second parameter.  If the second parameter is
equal to zero the allocated memory segments length is equal to
`OS_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_LENGTH'.  But in any case the segment
length is always not less than maximum alignment.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_DELETE'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_DELETE(os)'
        
</PRE>

is used for freeing all memory used by OS whose descriptor is
given as the macro parameter.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_EMPTY'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_EMPTY(os)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is used for removing all objects and freeing all memory
allocated for OS except for the first segment.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_TOP_FINISH'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_TOP_FINISH(os)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

creates new variable length object with initial zero length on
the top of OS whose descriptor is given as the macro
parameter.  The work (analogous to one with variable length
object) with object which was on the top of OS is finished,
i.e. the object will never more change address.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_TOP_NULLIFY'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_TOP_NULLIFY(os)'

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

makes that length of variable length object on the top of OS
whose descriptor is given as the macro parameter will be equal
to zero.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_TOP_LENGTH'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_TOP_LENGTH(os)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

returns current length of variable length object on the top of
OS whose descriptor is given as the macro parameter.</P>

<DT><B>Macros `OS_TOP_BEGIN', `OS_TOP_END', `OS_TOP_BOUND'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_TOP_BEGIN(os)', `OS_TOP_END(os)', `OS_TOP_BOUND(os)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

return pointer to correspondingly the first and the last byte
of variable length object on the top of OS whose descriptor is
given as the macros parameter, and pointer to the last byte
plus one.  Remember that the top object may change own place
after any addition.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_TOP_SHORTEN'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_TOP_SHORTEN(os, n)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

removes n bytes from the end of variable length object on the
top of OS whose descriptor is given as the first parameter.
The top variable length object is nullified if its length is
less than n.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_TOP_EXPAND'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_TOP_EXPAND(os, length)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

increases length of variable length object on the top of OS
whose descriptor is given as the first parameter on number of
bytes given as the second parameter.  The values of bytes
added to the end of variable length object on the top of OS
will be not defined.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_TOP_ADD_BYTE'</B><DD><P>

length object on the top of OS whose descriptor is given as
the first parameter.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

        `OS_TOP_ADD_MEMORY(os, str, length)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

adds memory starting with address given as the second macro
parameter and with length given as the third parameter to the
end of variable length object on the top of OS whose
descriptor is given as the first parameter.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `OS_TOP_ADD_STRING'</B><DD><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `OS_TOP_ADD_STRING(os, str)'
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

adds C string (with end marker 0) given as the second macro
parameter to the end of variable length string on the top of
OS whose descriptor is given as the first parameter.  Before
the addition the macro deletes last character of the top
variable length object.  The last character is suggested to be
C string end marker 0.</P>
