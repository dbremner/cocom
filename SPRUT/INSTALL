  Better way to install SPRUT is usage of top COCOM configure &
Makefile (see file INSTALL in the top COCOM directory).

  In any case you need to run configure in the top COCOM directory (in
order to create Makefile for SPRUT), to build AMMUNITION (because
SPRUT uses AMMUNITION for its building).  After that we can work with
only SPRUT (building, installation, and so on).  The SPRUT Makefile
has additional entries in comparison of the top COCOM Makefile.  These
are:

test - testing SPRUT
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only SPRUT

Example of SPRUT specifications are files `*.sput'.
