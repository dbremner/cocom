  Better way to install NONA is usage of top COCOM configure &
Makefile (see file INSTALL in the top COCOM directory).

  In any case you need to run configure in the top COCOM directory (in
order to create Makefile for NONA), to build AMMUNITION and SPRUT
(because NONA uses them for its building).  After that we can work
with only NONA (building, installation, and so on).  The NONA Makefile
has additional entries in comparison of the top COCOM Makefile.  These
are:

test - testing NONA
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only NONA

Example of NONA specification is files `a29k.nona' (part of a Pascal
cross-compiler for AM29050).
