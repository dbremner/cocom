<P>A specification as described in the previous section is translated
by code selector description translator (NONA) into code selector
description (CS) interface and implementation files having the same
names as one of specification file and correspondingly suffixes `.h'
and `.c' for C or `.cpp' for C++ (see option `-c++').</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="nona.html#toc3.1">C Interface objects</A>
</H2>

<P>C interface file of CS consists of the following definitions of
generated type and functions:
<OL>
<LI>There is constant with nonterminal name and prefix `CSNT_' for
each nonterminal.  `CSNT' is abbreviation of code selector
description nonterminal.  The constants are defined as macros
(with the aid of C preprocessor directive `#define').  The
constants are used as parameter of functions `CS_it_is_axiom'
and `CS_traverse_cover' (see below).
</LI>
<LI>Macro `CS_NODE' must represent type of node of low level
internal representation.  This macro can be redefined (only in
a C declaration section which starts with `%import').  By
default this macro is defined as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           #define CS_NODE           struct IR_node_struct *
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Macro `CS_TYPE' defines type of terminal and nonterminal
attributes.  This macro can not be redefined if the
corresponding code selector description has a construction
`%union' which already describes terminal and nonterminal
attribute types because in this case the default macro
definition is absent.  By default this macro is defined as
follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           #define CS_TYPE           CS_node
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Type `CS_node' is defined as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           typedef CS_NODE CS_node;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Type `CS_cover' describes a minimal cost cover.  The values of
this types are created by function `CS_find_cover' and deleted
by function `CS_delete_cover'.
</LI>
<LI>Function
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `CS_cover CS_find_cover (CS_node node)'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

makes the first bottom up pass on directed acyclic graph given
by its node and finds a minimal cost cover for each
nonterminal.  The minimal cost cover is returned.  If error
occurs during the pass then macro `CS_ERROR' (see below) is
evaluated.  For example, the cause of error may be meeting
undeclared terminal code.  During building cover, each
directed acyclic graph (DAG) node is visited only once.
</LI>
<LI>Function
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `int CS_it_is_axiom (CS_cover cover, int nonterminal)'
</PRE>

returns 1 if there is a minimal cost cover for given
nonterminal in given cover, 0 otherwise.
</LI>
<LI>Function
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `CS_TYPE CS_traverse_cover (CS_cover cover, int nonterminal)'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

makes the second bottom up, left to right pass and fulfills
actions corresponding a minimal cost cover for given
nonterminal in cover found by call of function
`CS_find_cover'.  A minimal cost cover for given nonterminal
must be in given cover before the function call.  This
condition can be checked by function `CS_it_is_axiom'.  The
function returns attribute of given nonterminal after
fulfilling the actions.  Remember that action (and attribute
evaluation) associated with tree pattern is fulfilled only
once for each occurrence of the tree pattern in given cover of
a directed acyclic graph.
</LI>
<LI>Function
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void CS_delete_cover (CS_cover cover)'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

frees memory allocated to `cover' which was to be created by
call of function `CS_find_cover'.  Of course this cover can
not be used in function `CS_traverse_cover' after that.  The
memory is freed in the reverse order therefore allocation
macros (see below) can use stack strategy of the memory
allocation.
</LI>
<LI>Function
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void CS_start (void)'
</PRE>

is to be called before any work with code selector
description.  The function initiates code selector description
storage management (see below).
</LI>
<LI>Function
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `void CS_finish (void)'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is to be last.  The function finishes code selector description
storage management.  Therefore only function `CS_start' can be
called after this function call.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="nona.html#toc3.3">Implementation file macros</A>
</H2>

<P>CS implementation file uses the following macros generated by NONA.
These macros can be redefined (in any C/C++ declaration section).
<OL>
<LI>Macro `CS_OPERATION(node)' must return value defined by a
constant which represents mode of the low level internal
representation node (see description of construction `%term').
</LI>
<LI>Macros
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `CS_OPERAND_1_OF_1(node)',
        `CS_OPERAND_1_OF_2(node)',
        `CS_OPERAND_2_OF_2(node)', and so on.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

These macros define the structure of the low level internal
representation for which is needed to build minimal cost
cover. The structure must be a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Macro of kind `CS_OPERAND_k_OF_n' defines k-th arc from the
DAG node given as the macro argument which has `n' such arcs.
Let us consider tree pattern
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `integer_plus (register, const8)'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

To access to children of node represented by terminal
`integer_plus' the macros `CS_OPERAND_1_OF_2' and
`CS_OPERAND_2_OF_2' will be used.
</LI>
<LI>Macros
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        `CS_STATE(node)',
        `CS_SET_STATE(node, state)'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

define access to the a DAG node field.  The field is used by
tree pattern matchers.  The type of this field must be any
pointer type.  Macro `CS_STATE' has one argument of type
`CS_node'.  Macro `CS_SET_STATE' has two arguments of types
correspondingly `CS_node' and `void *'.
</LI>
<LI>Macro `CS_ATTRIBUTE(node)' must return value of type
`CS_TYPE'.  This value is attribute of the terminal
corresponding to given node of low level internal
representation.

This macro for given terminal may be evaluated several times
because the terminal attribute can be in cost or constraint
constructions.  The value of the macro for the terminal must
be l-value (variable in other words) when construction
`%union' is present and given terminal is declared with type
because in this case the operation `.'  of C/C++ language is
applyed to the macro value in order to get access to the
terminal attribute.
</LI>
<LI>Macro `CS_ERROR(str)' is a reaction on fixing an error by tree
pattern matcher.  The macro argument is tree pattern matcher
message about the error.</LI>
</OL>

By default these macros are defined as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    #define CS_OPERATION(node)        IR_NODE_MODE (node)
    #define CS_OPERAND_1_OF_1(node)   IR_operand (node)

    #define CS_OPERAND_2_OF_3(node)   IR_operand_2 (node)
    #define CS_OPERAND_3_OF_3(node)   IR_operand_3 (node)
    ...
    #define CS_STATE(node)            IR_state (node)
    #define CS_SET_STATE(node, state) IR_set_state (node, state)
    #define CS_ATTRIBUTE(node)        (node)
    #define CS_ERROR(str)             fprintf (stderr, "%s\012", str)

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4</A> <A HREF="nona.html#toc3.4">Storage management macros</A>
</H2>

<P>NONA completely automatically generates macros of storage management
for the cover.  Usually, the user does not have to care about it.  The
predefined storage management uses C standard functions for global
storage with free lists.  The user can create own storage manager by
redefinition of one or more the following macros and placing them in a
C declaration section.  But the user should know that all functions
generated by NONA believe that the storage can not change its place
after the allocation.
<OL>
<LI>Macros `CS_START_ALLOC()', `CS_FINISH_ALLOC()' are evaluated in
functions correspondingly `CS_start' and `CS_finish' and are to
be used to start and finish work with the storage manager.
</LI>
<LI>Macros `CS_ALLOC(ptr, size, ptr_type)', `CS_FREE(ptr, size)'
allocate and free storage whose size is given as the second
parameter.  The first parameter serves to return pointer to
memory being allocated or to point to memory being freed.</LI>
</OL>

By default these macros are defined as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    #define CS_START_ALLOC()
    #define CS_FINISH_ALLOC()
    #define CS_ALLOC(ptr, size, ptr_type) \
                           ((ptr) = (ptr_type) malloc (size))
    #define CS_FREE(ptr, size)  free (ptr)
