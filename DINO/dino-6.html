<P>Statements denote actions.  There are <EM>simple</EM> and
<EM>compound</EM> statements.  Simple statements do not consist of any
parts that are statements themselves.  They are the assignment,
procedure call, return, break, continue, throw, and the wait
statements.  Analogous to the C language the last symbol of a Dino
simple statement is semicolon <CODE>;</CODE>.  Compound statements
consists of parts that are statements themselves.  They are used to
express sequencing, exception handling, conditional, and repetitive
execution.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.1">Empty statement</A>
</H2>

<P>There is also the empty statement in Dino.  It denotes no action.  The
empty statement is included in Dino for convenience.

Example: Usage of an empty statement in a for-statement:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          for (i = 0; a[i] == 0; i++)
            ;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.2">Block-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>A block-statement is simply a block and can used to group statements
into one statement and/or describe local declarations.  For details on
how the block is executed see section <EM>Declaration and Scope
Rules</EM>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ExecutiveStmt = BlockStmt

          BlockStmt = Block
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Example: Usage of a block-statement in a for-statement:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          sum = 0;
          for (i = 0; i &lt; #a; i++)
            {
              var value = a[i];
              if (value > 0)
                sum += value;

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.3">Assignment statements</A>
</H2>

<P>Assignment-statements are used to change variable values or element
values of a structured value which are referred through a designator
(see sub-section <EM>Designator</EM> in section <EM>Expressions</EM>.
The designator can not denote a final variable (see section
<EM>Variable Declaration</EM>).  You can not change the element value
of an immutable value (see section <EM>Types and Values</EM>).  In
this case exception <CODE>immutable</CODE> is generated.  Assignment to a
table element has a side effect, the element key becomes immutable.</P>
<P>A simple assignment statement looks like <CODE>Designator = Expr;</CODE>.
That means that the expression value is assigned to variable or
element of structured type value denoted by the designator.  For the
convenience of C programmers there are also the Dino assignments
<CODE>Designator op= Expr;</CODE>, <CODE>Designator++;</CODE>,
<CODE>++Designator;</CODE>, <CODE>Designator--;</CODE>, and
<CODE>--Designator;</CODE>.  They are analogous correspondingly to
<CODE>Designator = Designator op Expr;</CODE>, <CODE>Designator = Designator
+ 1;</CODE>, and <CODE>Designator = Designator - 1;</CODE>.  The only
difference is in the fact that the designator is evaluated only once,
not twice as in the analogous form.  It is important to know if you
have <EM>side effects</EM> in the statement.</P>
<P>A special construction <CODE>Designator &lt;=> Designator;</CODE> swaps values
of the designators.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.4">Call-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>A call-statement is used to call a function, a thread-function, or a
class.  It works analogous to the call in an expression (see
sub-section <EM>Calls</EM> in section <EM>Types and Values</EM>).  The
single difference is in that a call-statement throws away the call's
result.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.5">If-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>The Dino if-statement is analogous to the C language one.  First, the
expression after <CODE>if</CODE> is evaluated and arithmetic conversion is
done to it.  The value should be an integer or a floating-point
number, otherwise the exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is generated.  If the
value is nonzero the first statement is executed, otherwise the
statement after <CODE>else</CODE> is executed (if any).  The problem with
<EM>dangling else</EM> is resolved analogous to the C language --
<CODE>else</CODE> is associated with the closest <CODE>if</CODE>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ExecutiveStmt = if  "(" Expr ")" Stmt [ else Stmt ]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          if (i &lt; 0) i = 0;
          if (i &lt; j) return -1; else if (i > 0) return 1; else return 0;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.6">For-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>The Dino for-statement is analogous to the C language one.  The
statement is executed in the following way.
<OL>
<LI>Execution of the first statement in the parentheses.</LI>
<LI>The expression (<EM>for-guard</EM>) is evaluated and
implicit arithmetic conversion is made.  The value should be
an integer or a floating point number.  If this is not true,
exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is generated.</LI>
<LI>If the value of for-guard is nonzero, the body of the loop
(the last statement) is executed.  Otherwise, the
for-statement execution finishes.</LI>
<LI>When the body has been executed, the second statement in
the parentheses is executed and steps 2,3,4 (one iteration) are
repeated.</LI>
</OL>

If the second statement is a simple statement, the statement semicolon
can be omitted.  The for-statement also can be finished by execution
of the statement <CODE>break</CODE> in the body.  The body can be finished
by execution of statement <CODE>continue</CODE>.  In this case, the
for-statement execution continues with the step 4.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++;) sum += v [i];
          for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) sum += v [i];
          for ({sum = 0; i = 0;} i &lt; 10; i++) sum += v [i];

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.7">Foreach-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>This statement is used to execution of the foreach-statement body (the
statement) for all keys of table which is value of the expression.
The expression value should be a table.  If this is not true,
exception <CODE>keyop</CODE> is generated.  The current key value on each
iteration is assigned to the designator.  The order in which the key
values are assigned on each iteration is undefined.  One iteration can
be finished with the aid of the statement <CODE>continue</CODE> and a
foreach-statement can be finished by execution of statement
<CODE>break</CODE>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ExecutiveStmt = for  "("  Designator in Expr ")" Stmt
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.8">Break- and continue-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>Statements <CODE>break</CODE> and <CODE>continue</CODE> are used
correspondingly to finish execution of the closest-containing for- or
foreach-statement covering the statement and to finish one iteration
of the body of the for- or foreach-statement.  These statement can be
used only inside a for- or foreach-statement.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ExecutiveStmt = break ";"
                        | continue ";"
</PRE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
             if (ind [i] &lt; 0)
               continue;
             val = v [ind[i]];
          }

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.9">Return-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>Return-statement is used to finish execution of a function, a thread,
or class block.  The statement corresponds to the closest-containing
function, thread-function, or class covering the statement, so the
return-statement can be placed only in a function, a function-thread,
or a class.  The expression in a return-statement can be given only
for functions.  In this case, the expression value will be the value
of the function call (instead of the default result value
<B>nil</B>).

<H2><A NAME="ss6.10">6.10</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.10">Throw-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>This statement generates an exception which is given by value of the
expression.  The expression should evaluate to an object of
predeclared class <CODE>except</CODE> or an object of a class declared
somewhere in predeclared class <CODE>except</CODE>.  If this is not true,
exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is generated.  How exceptions are processed
is described in the following section.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ExecutiveStmt = throw  Expr ";"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ext except {
            ext error {
              class myexcept (msg) {}
            }
          }
          throw errors.myexcept ("this is an user defined exception");

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.11">6.11</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.11">Try-block</A>
</H2>

<P>Exceptions can be generated by the Dino interpreter when some
conditions are not satisfied, by predeclared Dino functions, by other
OS processes, by user interruptions, or by the user with the aid of a
throw-statement.  Actually, the exceptions are represented by an
object of the predeclared class <CODE>except</CODE> or by an object of a
class declared inside the predeclared class <CODE>except</CODE>.  All
predeclared exceptions are described in the section <EM>Predeclared
Identifiers</EM>.  To detect and process exceptions, a try-block can
be used.</P>
<P>When an exception is generated, the closest-containing try-block which
is covering the statement generating the exception or currently being
executed (when this is is generated by an OS process or by an user
interruption) is searched for.  Then, expressions in the catch list
elements are processed.  The expression value in the catch list
element being currently processed should be the predeclared class
<CODE>except</CODE> or a class declared inside the predeclared class
<CODE>except</CODE>.  If the expression being processed is a class and the
exception is an object of the class or an object of a class declared
inside the class, the block corresponding to the given catch list
element is executed.  If there is no such catch expression, the
closest-containing try-block covering the current try-block is
searched for and processing the exception is repeated.  If there are
no more try-blocks, the program finishes with a diagnostic message
which is dependent on the generated exception.</P>
<P>Blocks corresponding to catch list elements have a predeclared
variable <CODE>e</CODE>.  When block execution starts, the variable
contains the object representing the exception.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ExecutiveStmt = TryBlockStmt

          TryBlockStmt = try Block { Catch }

<H2><A NAME="ss6.12">6.12</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc6.12">Wait-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>This statement is used for the synchronization of different threads in
a Dino program.  The expression can not contain a function, class, or
a thread-function call.  The thread in which the statement has been
executed waits until the expression value becomes nonzero.  The
expression value (after implicit arithmetic conversion) should be an
integer or a floating point number.  Otherwise the exception
<CODE>optype</CODE> is generated.  When the expression value becomes
nonzero, the statement after the expression (it is called
sync-statement) is executed without interruption by other process.  It
is used as critical region for process synchronization.  In a critical
region execution of wait-statement is prohibited (it results in
generation of exception <CODE>syncwait</CODE>).  Also thread calls inside
a critical region result in generation exception
<CODE>syncthreadcall</CODE>.
