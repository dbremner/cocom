  Better way to install DINO is usage of top COCOM configure &
Makefile (see file INSTALL in the top COCOM directory).

  In any case you need to run configure in the top COCOM directory (in
order to create Makefile for DINO), to build AMMUNITION, SPRUT,
SHILKA, and MSTA (because DINO uses them for its building).  After
that we can work with only DINO (building, installation, and so on).
The DINO Makefile has additional entries in comparison of the top
COCOM Makefile.  These are:

test - testing DINO
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only DINO
???
Examples of DINO specifications file are in `c5.y', `cpp5.y',
`fcalc.y', `fparse.y', `gram.y', `java.y', `m2c.y', `p-yacc.y',
`sql1.y'.  Example of DINO scanner specification file is in `lex.y'.
