NAME
       dino - the interpreter of the programming language DINO

SYNOPSIS
       dino  [  -s  -h  size -Idirname -Lpath -p] (-c program | program-file )
       dino-program-arguments

DESCRIPTION
       dino interprets a program in the DINO programming language.   The  pro-
       gram file (and include files) must have the suffix .d

       The  description  of  DINO language is in the report of the Programming
       Language DINO.

OPTIONS
       The options which the DINO interpreter recognizes are:

       -c program
              Execute the Dino program given on the command line as the  argu-
              ment.

       -h number
              Determine  the  size  of the heap chunks used by the DINO inter-
              preter.  The size can be given in bytes (e.g. 32000),  in  kilo-
              bytes  (e.g.  64k), or in megabytes (e.g. 1m).  The default size
              is 1 Megabyte.  Initially,  the  Dino  interpreter  creates  one
              chunk.   It  allocates one additional chunk (as rule of the same
              size) whenever there is no additional memory after garbage  col-
              lection.

       -s     Output some statistics of interpreter work into stderr.  Statis-
              tics contain the maximal heap size, number of heap  chunks,  and
              number  of  collisions  in  hash  tables  which are used for the
              implementation of DINO tables.

       -Idirname
              Define the  directory  in  which  Dino  include  files  will  be
              searched  for.  The order of searching in directories given with
              this option is the same as the one on the command line.

       -Ldirname
              Define where to serach for external libraries (if shared or  dll
              libraries  are  implemented  on  the  system.   This is true for
              Linux, Solaris, Irix, OSF, and Windows) in which the Dino exter-
              nal  variables and functions will be searched for.  The order of
              searching in libraries given with this option is the same as one
              on the command line.

       -p     Output  profile  information  into  stderr.  Profile information
              contains the number of calls and execution times of  all  called
              functions and classes.

FILES
       file.d
              a DINO program file
       libdino.so
              a DINO shared library on some Unix systems.
       mpi.d
              the DINO file implementing multiple precision arithmetic.
       mpi.so
              the  DINO  shared library used for implementing MPI on some Unix
              systems.
       mpi.dll
              the DINO dll library used for implementing MPI on  Windows  sys-
              tems.
       ieee.d
              the  DINO  file implementing IEEE standard floating point arith-
              metic.
       ieee.so
              the DINO shared library used for implementing IEEE on some  Unix
              systems.
       ieee.dll
              the  DINO dll library used for implementing IEEE on Windows sys-
              tems.
       ipcerr.d
              the DINO file definining  exceptions  of  ipc/network  software.
              This file is used by socket.d.
       ipcerr.so
              the  DINO  shared  library  used for implementing IPCERR on some
              Unix systems.
       ipcerr.dll
              the DINO dll library used for  implementing  IPCERR  on  Windows
              systems.
       socket.d
              the DINO file implementing work with sockets.
       socket.so
              the  DINO  shared  library  used for implementing SOCKET on some
              Unix systems.
       socket.dll
              the DINO dll library used for  implementing  SOCKET  on  Windows
              systems.
       There are no temporary files used by DINO.

ENVIRONMENT
       There  are the following environment variables which affect DINO behav-
       ior:

       DINO_HOME
              If not null, it defines the places of the dino shared  libraries
              (such a library may be only on some Unix systems including Linux
              and  Solaris),  include  files,  and  dino   standard   external
              libraries.   The  places  are defined as the subdirectory lib in
              directory given by the environment variable value.   You  should
              define  the variable value on Windows if you installed the files
              in a directory other than C:\dino\lib

       DINO_PATH
              If not null, it defines the places of dino  include-files.   The
              value  of the variable has more priority than DINO_HOME but less
              priority than values given through -I options.

       DINO_LIB
              If not null, it defines places of dino shared library,  if  any.
              The value of variable has more priority than DINO_HOME.

       DINO_EXTERN_LIBS
              If  not  null,  it  defines  paths  of  additional Dino external
              libraries.  The libraries should be separated by ":"  (on  Unix)
              or  ";"  (on  Windows).  The value has less priority than values
              given in -L options.

DIAGNOSTICS
       DINO diagnostics are self-explanatory.
