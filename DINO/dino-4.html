<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Declarations and Scope Rules</A></H2>

<P>A Dino program is block structured.  Each block introduces a new
identifier scope.  A block consists of executive statements and
declarations and may contain nested blocks.  Each identifier used in a
program should be declared in a declaration in the program, unless it
is a predeclared identifier.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Block = "{"  StmtList "}"

          StmtList = { Stmt }
        
          Stmt = ExecutiveStmt
               | Declaration
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

When declaring an identifier, you also specify certain permanent
properties of a declaration, such as whether it is a variable, a
function, or a class.  The identifier is then used to refer to the
associated declaration (more correctly with the declaration instance).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Declaration = VarDeclarations
                      | AccessClause
                      | ExternDeclarations
                      | FuncClassExtDeclaration
                      | IncludeDeclaration
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The scope of a declaration is textually from the start (not from the
point of declaration!) to the end of the block to which the
declaration belongs and hence to which the declaration is local.  It
excludes the scopes of declarations with the same identifier which are
in nested blocks.  In a block, a maximum of one declaration of the
same identifier is possible.
<P>It is important to understand the notion of instantiation of the
declaration.  This notion reflects program execution, not the static
structure of program.  An instance exists in a <EM>context</EM>.
Actually, a context is an execution environment consisting of the
covering block instances and/or class objects.  A new instance of the
block is created when execution of the block starts.  There may be
more than one instance of the same block, e.g. when the block is a
function or class body (in this case the block instance is a class
object), or when the block is executed on different threads (parallel
execution branches) or when there is a reference to a block instance
after its execution.  When a new instance of the block starts, all the
block declarations are instantiated too.  For a variable declaration,
it means a new instance of variable is created in the given context.
For a function or class declaration, it means that the function or
class is bound to the given context.
<P>Example: 
The following program illustrates a case when a reference to
a block instance exists after its execution.  The program
outputs the result 8.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          var i, f;
        
          for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
            if (i % 4 == 0)
              {
                var j = i;
                func r () {return j;}
                f = r;
              }
          putln (f ());
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Declaration is always either private or public.  Private declaration
is accessible only inside the declaration scope or inside functions or
classes which are declared as <EM>friend</EM> in the declaration
block.  A public declaration instance is always accessible when
association (see below) of the identifier is successful.  By default,
[instances of] declarations in a class block are public.  In all other
places, the (instances of) declarations are private by default.  The
following constructions are used for declaring an identifier to be
public, private, or as friend:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          AccessClause = (public | private | friend) AccessList ";"

          AccessList = IDENT { "," IDENT }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          public param1, param2;
          private call_count;
          friend class2;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Association of an identifier and the corresponding declaration
instance is performed by the following rules:
<UL>
<LI>The corresponding declaration instance is searched for a
separate identifier occurrence in the instance of the block in
which the identifier occurs.  If the latter failed, the
declaration is searched in the covering block instance of the
current block instance, and so on.</LI>
<LI>Declaration instance for an identifier in the following
construction
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       designator.identifier
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is searched in the block instance (e.g. in a class object)
whose value is in the designator.  If the designator is a class
object, its context is a class object, and the search failed,
the search is continued in the covering class object etc.  The
exception <CODE>accessop</CODE> occurs if the declaration is not
found with such identifier, or the declaration is private and
the construction is not in the declaration scope and not inside
a friend of the declaration scope.</LI>
<LI>Declaration instance for an identifier whose name is an
expression value in the following construction
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       *(expression)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is searched in the same way as a separate identifier.  The
exception <CODE>accessop</CODE> occurs if there is no such instance
of a declaration with such an identifier in the covering block
instances.</LI>
<LI>The declaration for an identifier in the following
construction
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       (expression)->identifier
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is searched in an analogous way to the construction
<CODE>designator.identifier</CODE> in the block instance which is
the value of the variable whose name is given by the
expression.  The variable is searched in the same way as in the
construction <CODE>*(expression)</CODE>.  Exception
<CODE>accessop</CODE> occurs if there is no such variable instance
with the given name in covering block instances, there is no
instance of the declaration with such identifier in the given
context (the variable value), or the declaration is private and
the construction is not in the declaration scope.</LI>
</UL>

The following identifiers are predeclared on the top level (in the
implicit block covering the whole program).  They are described in
more detail later in the report.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Variable Declarations</A>
</H2>

<P>Dino is an imperative language. In other words it has
<EM>variables</EM> which are named containers of values.  A variable
can contain any value.  This means that DINO is a dynamically-typed
language.  The declaration of a variable also may define the initial
value of the variable.  Assigning of the initial value to the variable
instance is made after execution of the previous statements of the
block.  By default the initial value of variables is the special value
<B>nil</B>.  The value of the variable can not be changed after its
initialization if its declaration contains the keyword <B>final</B>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          VarDeclarations = var  VarParList ";"

          VarParList = VarPar { "," VarPar }
        
          VarPar = [final] IDENT [ "="  Expr]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 External Declarations</A>
</H2>

<P>Dino permits to use functions written in other languages, e.g. C.  The
functions should have special prototypes and must have to access to
the DINO standard procedural interface (SPI).  Dino can also have
access to variables of a special type declared in the source code in
another language.  The details of the implementation of such features
and the DINO SPI are not described here (some details are given in
appendix B).  As rule, the external functions and variables will be
implemented as dynamically loaded libraries.  This is the powerful
instrument of DINO extension.  The external functions and variables
are declared after keyword <B>extern</B>.  An external function
identifier is followed by <CODE>()</CODE>.  All external declarations
(e.g. in different blocks) with the same identifier refer the the same
external function or variable.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ExternDeclarations = extern  ExternItem { "," ExternItem } ";"

          ExternItem = IDENT 
                     | IDENT  "(" ")"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          extern function (), variable;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Functions, Classes, Extensions</A>
</H2>

<P>A function/class declaration consists of a function/class header and a
function/class block (body).  The header specifies the function
identifier and <EM>formal parameters</EM>.  A function can return the
result with the aid of the statement <EM>return</EM>.  If the result
value after the keyword <EM>return</EM> is absent or the return
statement is absent or is not executed, the function returns
<B>nil</B> by default.  A class call returns an object of the class
which can be considered as a block instance of the class body.  The
return-statement for classes must be without a result.
<EM>Thread-functions</EM> are analogous to general functions.  The
difference is in that a new execution <EM>thread</EM> is created
during the thread-function call, the return-statement inside
thread-function must be without an expression, and the thread-function
returns the corresponding (execution) thread.  The execution thread
finishes when the corresponding thread block finishes.  Execution
threads are executed parallelly.  Originally only one thread (called
the <EM>main thread</EM>) exists in a DINO program.
<P>The formal parameters are considered to be declared in a
function/class block and to be initialized by values of <EM>actual
parameters</EM> during a call of the function/class.  The function can
be called with any number of <EM>actual parameters</EM>.  If the
number of actual parameters is less than the formal parameters number,
the remaining formal parameters are initialized by the special value
<B>nil</B>.  Otherwise if the number of actual parameters is more
than the number of formal parameters, the remaining actual parameter
values are ignored.  In order to process all actual parameters, you
should place <CODE>...</CODE> at the end of the list of formal parameter
declarations.  This means that the formal parameter with the
identifier <CODE>args</CODE> will be declared implicitly.  The value of
the parameter will be a vector whose elements will be the remaining
actual parameter values.  If the number of actual parameters is less
or equal to the number of formal parameters (not taking the implicit
parameter <CODE>args</CODE> into account), the value of <CODE>args</CODE> will
be the empty vector.  The formal parameter can be initialized by a
default value in a way analogous to variable initialization.  The
initialization is made only when the corresponding actual parameter
value is <B>nil</B>.
<P>If a class contains a function with the name <CODE>destroy</CODE>, the function
will be called when the class object becomes garbage during the
garbage collection process.  The function can also be called explicitly if it
is declared as public.  You should be remember that although the
function may have parameters and return a value, the garbage collector
ignores the result value and does not pass actual parameters.  So the
values of the parameters will be <B>nil</B> if the function is
called by the garbage collector.  You may prevent removing the
corresponding object in the function destroy by assigning the object
to a variable.  It means that the function can be called several times
(during several garbage collections) for the same object.  But you
should also avoid creation of objects during the call of function
<CODE>destroy</CODE> because it may result in increase of the heap.
<P>Instead of inheritance usually used in object-oriented languages, Dino
supports <EM>extension</EM>.  This feature permits to modify
function/class behaviour.  All code inside an extension body is
inserted at the end of body of the function/class declared with the
same identifier in the same block in the same order as the extensions
are placed in the block.  A function/class declared as <EM>final</EM>
can not be extended.
