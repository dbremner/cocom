<P>Wherever it is possible, we use also EBNF for description of lexical
symbols through ASCII set characters.  Otherwise, we use natural
language sentences in <CODE>&lt;</CODE> and <CODE>></CODE>.  Lexical symbols are
identifiers, numbers, character constants, strings, operators,
delimiters, and comments.  White characters (blanks and line breaks)
must not occur within the symbols (except in comments, and blanks in
strings).  White characters are ignored unless they are essential to
separate two consecutive lexical symbols.  Upper- and lower-case
letters are considered to be distinct.
<OL>
<LI><EM>Identifier</EM> is sequence of letters and digits starting
with a letter.  Underline is believed to be a letter for identifier.

<LI>Dino <EM>character constant</EM> denotes an ASCII
character.  The following sequences starting with backslash
have special meaning inside Dino character constant:
<UL>
<LI><CODE><B>\a</B>    -</CODE> ASCII character alert</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\b</B>    -</CODE> ASCII character backspace</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\f</B>    -</CODE> ASCII character form feed</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\n</B>    -</CODE> ASCII character new line</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\r</B>    -</CODE> ASCII character carriage return</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\t</B>    -</CODE> ASCII character horizontal tab</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\v</B>    -</CODE> ASCII character vertical tab</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\code</B> -</CODE> ASCII character with given octal code</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\char</B> -</CODE> ASCII character char for all remaining characters</LI>
</UL>

To denote single quote mark use sequence <CODE>\'</CODE>.  Double
quote mark can be represented either by <CODE>\"</CODE> or simply
by <CODE>"</CODE>.  To represent backslash inside the character
constant, use two ASCII backslashes.

</LI>
<LI><EM>Strings</EM> are sequence of ASCII characters enclosed
in double quote marks. There are the same sequences of ASCII
characters with special meaning as in character constant.  To
denote double quote mark use sequence <CODE>\"</CODE>.  Single
quote mark can be represented either by <CODE>\'</CODE> or simply
by <CODE>'</CODE>.  To represent backslash inside the character
constant, use two ASCII backslashes.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</LI>
<LI>Remaining essential symbols are called <EM>operators</EM> and
<EM>delimiters</EM>.  Operators are used for forming expressions,
delimiters are used for forming syntax constructions.  There
is special kind of operators and delimiters which look like
identifiers containing only lower-case letters.  They are
reserved identifiers (keywords).  Keywords can not be used on
the place of identifier.

<LI><EM>Comments</EM> are considered analogous to blanks on syntax level
of the program.  There are two type of comments.  The first
comment is arbitrary character sequences starting with <CODE>/*</CODE>

<CODE>//</CODE> and finishes with the first line break or with the end of
file.
