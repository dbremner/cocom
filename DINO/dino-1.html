<P>DINO is high level scripting dynamic-typed language.  DINO is designed
taking such design principles as simplicity, uniformity, and
expressiveness into account.  Dino is oriented on the same domain of
applications as famous scripting languages Perl, TCL, Python.  The
most of programmers know C language.  Therefore Dino aims to look like
C language where it is possible.  Dino is an object oriented language
with garbage collection.  Dino has possibilities of parallelism
description and exceptions handling.  Dino is an extensible language
with possibility of dynamic load of libraries written on other
languages.  The high level structures of Dino are
<UL>
<LI>heterogenous extensible vectors</LI>
<LI>extensible associative tables with possibilities of deleting
table elements</LI>
<LI>objects</LI>
</UL>
<P>Originally, Dino was used in russian graphics company ANIMATEK (
<A HREF="http://www.animatek.com">Animatek</A>) for description of
movement of dinosaurs in an project.  It has been considerably
redesigned and implemented with the aid of COCOM tool set.
<P>This document is not a programmer's tutorial.  It is concise
description of language DINO and can be used as programmer's
reference.
