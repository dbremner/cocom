.SH NAME
dino \- interpreter of the programming language DINO
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dino [ -s -h size -Idirname -Lpath -p] (-c
.I program
.B |
.I program-file
.B ) dino-program-arguments
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dino
interprets program on DINO programming language.  The
program file (and include files) must have suffix
.B .d
.
.PP
Description of DINO language is in report of the Programming Language DINO.
.SH OPTIONS
The options which are known for DINO interpreter are:
.IP "-c program"
Execute Dino
.B program
given on the command line as argument.
.IP "-h number"
Determine the size of the heap chunks used by DINO interpreter.  The
size can be given in bytes (e.g. 32000), in kilobytes (e.g. 64k), or
in megabytes (e.g. 1m).  The default size is 1 Megabyte.  Initially,
Dino interpreter creates one chunk.  It allocates additional chunk
(as rule of the same size) whenever there are no additional memory
after garbage collection.
.IP -s
Output some statistics of interpreter work into stderr.  Statistics
contains maximal heap size, number of heap chunks, and number of
collisions in hash tables which are used for implementation DINO
tables.
.IP -Idirname
Define directory in which Dino include files will be searched for.
The order searching in directories given with this option is the same
as one on the command line.
.IP -Ldirname
Define external libraries (if shared or dll libraries are implemented
on the system.  this is true for Linux, Solaris, Irix, OSF, and
Windows) in which Dino external variable and functions will be
searched for.  The order searching in libraries given with this option
is the same as one on the command line.
.IP -p
Output profile information into stderr.  Profile information contains
number of calls and exceution times of all called functions and
classes.
.SH FILES
.I file.d
.RS
DINO program file
.RE
.I libdino.so
.RS
DINO shared library on some Unix systems.
.RE
.I mpi.d
.RS
DINO file implementing multiple precision arithmetic.
.RE
.I mpi.so
.RS
DINO shared library used by for implementing MPI on some Unix systems.
.RE
.I mpi.dll
.RS
DINO dll library used by for implementing MPI on Windows systems.
.RE
.I ieee.d
.RS
DINO file implementing IEEE standrad floating point arithmetic.
.RE
.I ieee.so

DINO shared library used by for implementing IEEE on some Unix systems.
.RE
.I ieee.dll
.RS

.RE
There are no any temporary files used by DINO.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
There are the following environment variables which affect DINO behavior:
.IP DINO_HOME
If non-null, it defines places of dino shared library (such library
may be only on some Unix systems including Linux, Solaris), include
files, dino standard external libraries.  The places are defined as
subdirectory
.B lib
in directory given by the environment variable value.  You should
define the variable value on Windows if you installed the files not in
directory
.B "C:\\\\dino\\\\lib"
.IP DINO_PATH
If non-null, it defines place of dino include-files.  The value of
variable has more priority than
.B DINO_HOME
but less priority than values given in
.B -I
options.
.IP DINO_LIB
If non-null, it defines places of dino shared library, if any.  The value of
variable has more priority than
.B DINO_HOME.
.IP DINO_EXTERN_LIBS
If non-null, it defines paths of dino additional external libraries.
The libraries should be separated by `:' (on Unix) or `;' (on Windows).
The value has less priority than values given in
.B -L
options.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
DINO diagnostics is self-explanatory.
