<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Expressions</A></H2>

<P>Expressions are constructs denoting rules of computation of a value
from other values by the application of <EM>operators</EM>.
Expressions consist of <EM>operands</EM> and operators.  Parentheses
may be used to express specific associations of operators and
operands.  Dino is a dynamic-typed language.  That means that variable
can store any Dino value.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Types and Values</A>
</H2>

<P>All Dino values are <EM>the first class values</EM>, i.e. they can be
assigned to a variable, can be passed as a parameter of
function/class, and can be returned by functions.  Operators require
operands whose values are of given types and return value of the
result type.  The most of values have a represention in Dino.  When a
value representation is encountered in expression during the
expression evaluation, the new value is generated.
<P>There are values of <EM>structured types</EM>, i.e. values which are
built from other values.  The value of a structured type may be
<EM>mutable</EM> or <EM>immutable</EM>.  Value or sub-value of mutable
value can be changed.  Immutable value can not be changed after its
generation.  You can make mutable value an immutable by applying
operator <CODE>final</CODE> as side effect.  In all cases, the operator
returns the operand value as the result.  If you try to change
immutable value, exception <CODE>immutable</CODE> is generated.  You can
make new mutable value as side effect of applying operator
<CODE>new</CODE>.  The operator returns new value equal to the operand
value.

          Expr = final  Expr
               | new  Expr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Structured value types are also <EM>shared value types</EM>.  This
notion means that if two or more different variables (array elements
or table elements or keys) refer for the same value and the value is
changed through one variable, the value which is referred through
other variables is changed too.  There is no difference between notion
"the same value" and notion "equal values" for non-shared type values.
For the shared type operands, the equality means that the operands
have the same structure (e.g. vectors with the same length) and the
corresponding element values are the same.
<P>Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          new 5
          new ['a', 'b', 'c']
          new "abc"
          new {"key0" : 10, "key1" : 20}
          final 5
          final ['a', 'b', 'c']
          final "abc"
          final {"key0" : 10, "key1" : 20}

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI><EM>vector</EM>.  This is a structured shared type
value.  Vector value is represented by list of values (or
expressions) in brackets with optional repetitions of the
vector elements followed by <CODE>:</CODE>.  The repetition
value is conversed into integer value by default.  If the
repetition value after this is not of integer, exception
<CODE>optype</CODE> is generated. If the repetition value is
negative or zero, the element value will be absent in the
vector.  Elements of vector are accessed by their
indexes.  Indexes always starts with 0.  Vectors in Dino
are heterogenous, i.e. elements of a vector may be of
different types.  String represents immutable vector
whose all elements are characters in the string.
Elements of mutable vectors can be added to or removed
from the vector (see predefined functions <EM>ins, insv,
del</EM>).

<LI><EM>table</EM>.  This is a structured shared type
value.  Table value is represented by list of key values
(expression values) in figure parentheses <CODE>{</CODE> and
<CODE>}</CODE> with optional element values with preceding
<CODE>:</CODE>.  By default element value is equal to
<B>nil</B>.  It is not possible to have elements with
equal keys in a table.  If it is not true in a table
constructor, exception <CODE>keyvalue</CODE> is generated.
Elements of tables are accessed by their keys.  Elements
of mutable tables can be added to or removed from the
table correspondingly by assigning value and with the
aid function <EM>del</EM>.  The side effect of table
constructor execution is that the keys become immutable.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Designators</A>
</H2>

<P>There is special Dino construction called <EM>designator</EM>.
Designator refers for an vector or table element or for an
declaration.  If designator refers for vector or table element or for
variable declaration, it can stand in left hand side of assignment
statement.  If the designator stands in an expression, the
corresponding value is used (vector/table element value, variable
value, function, thread-function, or class).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Expr = Designator
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Designator referring for a vector element has the following syntax
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Designator = DesignatorOrCall "["  Expr "]"

          DesignatorOrCall = Designator
                           | Call
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The value of the construction before the brackets must be a vector.
Otherwise, the exception <CODE>indexop</CODE> is generated.  The value of
expression in the brackets (so called <EM>index</EM>) is conversed to
integer.  If it is not possible, exception <CODE>indextype</CODE> is
generated.  If index is negative or greater or equal to the vector
length, the exception <CODE>indexvalue</CODE> is generated.  The value of
the designator will be the vector element value with given index (the
indexes starts with zero).
Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          vect [1]
          vect ["1"]
          vect [1.0]
</PRE>

Designator referring for a table element has the following syntax
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Designator = DesignatorOrCall "{"  Expr "}"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The value of the construction before the figure brackets must be a
table.  Otherwise, the exception <CODE>keyop</CODE> is generated.  The
value of expression in the figure brackets is called <EM>key</EM>.
The value of the designator will be the table element value with key
which is equal to given key.  If the element with given key is absent
in the table, exception <CODE>keyvalue</CODE> is generated.
Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          tab {'c'}
          tab {10}
          tab {"1"}
          tab {1.0}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The remaining forms of designator refer for a declaration.  See
section <EM>Declarations and Scope Rules</EM> describing how they
work.

          Designator = DesignatorOrCall "."  IDENT
                     | "(" Expr ")" "->"  IDENT

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Call</A>
</H2>

<P>One form of expression is call of function, thread-function, or class.
The value of designator before the actual parameters should be
function, thread-function, or class.  Otherwise, exception
<CODE>callop</CODE> is generated.  Instance of block corresponding to the
body of the function, thread-function, or class is created.  The
actual parameter values are assigned to the corresponding formal
parameters.  If the corresponding function, thread-function, or class
has no default formal parameter <CODE>args</CODE> (see section
<EM>Declarations</EM>), the remaining actual parameter values are
ignored.  Otherwise, vector whose elements are the remaining parameter
values are created and assigned to parameter <CODE>args</CODE>.  If there
is no corresponding actual parameter for a formal parameter, the
default parameter value (see section <EM>Declarations</EM>) or value
<B>nil</B> are assigned to the formal parameter.  Then statements in
the block are executed.  If it is call of a thread-function, new
execution thread is created, and the statements of the block is
executed in the new thread.  The value of call of the thread-function
is the corresponding thread.  It is returned before starting execution
of the statements in the new thread.
<P>Execution of the body is finished by achieving the block end or by
execution of return-statement.  Finishing of thread-function results
in finishing the corresponding thread.  The return-statement in
thread-function or in class should be without an expression.  The call
of class returns the created object.  Function call returns value of
the expression in the executed return-statement.  Otherwise, the
function call returns value <B>nil</B>.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Operators</A>
</H2>

<P>Expressions consist of operands and operators.  Order in which
operators are executed in expression is defined by their
<EM>priority</EM> and <EM>associativity</EM> of operators.  That means
that expression <CODE>a op1 b op2 c</CODE> when operators <CODE>op2</CODE> has
higher priority than <CODE>op1</CODE> is analogous to <CODE>a op1 (b op2
b)</CODE>.  Dino operators have the analogous priorities as ones in C
language.  The following Dino operators are placed in their priority
(the higher line on which the operator is place, the higher its
priority).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

All binary operators have left associativity in Dino.  That means that
expression <CODE>a op1 b op2 c</CODE> when operators <CODE>op1</CODE> and
<CODE>op2</CODE> have the same priority is analogous to <CODE>(a op1 b) op2
b</CODE>.  Parentheses may be used to express specific associations of
operators and operands.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Expr = "(" Expr ")"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The most of Dino operators require that the operands to be of given
types.  If an operand is not given type, the conversion of it into the
type may be made.  If after the possible conversion the operands are
not still of necessary types, exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is generated
(when something special about exceptions in this case is not
mentioned).  The following conversion may be made by default:
<UL>
<LI><EM>Integer conversion</EM>.  If the operand is a character,
its code becomes integer.  If the operand is a floating point
number, its fractional part is thrown away and integral part
becomes integer.  If the operand is a vector of characters, the
corresponding string is believed to be decimal representation
of integer and is conversed into the corresponding integer.  If
the corresponding string is not a correct integer
representation, the result is undefined.  If the corresponding
string represents an integer whose representation requires more
32 bits, exception <CODE>erange</CODE> may be generated.  In all
remaining cases the result of conversion coincide with the
operand.</LI>
<LI><EM>Arithmetic conversion</EM>.  Analogous to integer
conversion except for that conversion float pointing number ->
integer is not made and if the string represents floating point
number (i.e. contains exponent or fraction), the result will be
the corresponding floating point number instead of integer.
Additionally if the operand is in a non-short circuit binary
operator (non logical operators) and another operand is
floating point number after the conversion, the first operand
is conversed into floating point number too.  Analogously if
the result is an integer which can not be represented by 32-bit
integer or the result is an floating point number not
represented by IEEE double, the exception <CODE>erange</CODE> may
be generated.</LI>
<LI><EM>String conversion</EM>.  If the operand is a character,
the result will be a new string (immutable vector of
characters) with one element which is the character.  If the
operand is an integer or a floating point number, the result
will be new string of characters which is a decimal string
representation of the number.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Logical operators</H3>

<P>Logical operators produce integer result 1 which means <EM>true</EM>
or 0 which means <EM>false</EM>.  Logical `or' <CODE>||</CODE> and logical
`and' <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> are <EM>short circuit</EM> operators.  That means
that the second operand is evaluated depending on the result of the
first operand.  When the operands of the operators are evaluated, the
arithmetic conversion is made.
<P>If the first result of logical `or' is nonzero (integer or floating
point), the result will be 1.  Otherwise, the second operand is
evaluated.  If the second operand is nonzero, the result will be 1.
Otherwise, the result will be 0.
<P>If the first result of logical `and' is zero (integer or floating
point), the result will be 0.  Otherwise, the second operand is
evaluated.  If the second operand is nonzero, the result will be 1.
Otherwise, the result will be 0.
<P>Logical negotiation `!' makes impilict integer conversion of the
operand.  If the operand is zero (integer or floating point), the
result will be 1.  Otherwise, the result will be 0.
<P>Operator <CODE>in</CODE> checks that there is an element with given key
(the first operand) in given table (the second operand).  If the
element is in the table, the result will be 1.  Otherwise the result
will be 0.  If the second operand is not a table, exception
<CODE>keyop</CODE> is generated.

<H3>Comparison operators</H3>

<P>All comparison operators return a logical value (integer 0 which
means false or integer 1 which means true).
<P>Operator equality <CODE>==</CODE> and inequality <CODE>!=</CODE> may make some
conversion of the operands.  If one of the two operands is string,
then the string conversion is applied to another operand before the
comparison.  Otherwise, the standard arithmetic conversion is applied
to the operands.  The operators do not generate exceptions (but the
conversions may).  The operands are equal if they have the same type
and equal values (see section <EM>Types and Values</EM>).
<P>Operators identity <CODE>===</CODE> and unidentity <CODE>!==</CODE> returns 1
if the operands have the same value or 0 otherwise.  The operators never
generates exceptions.
<P>By default the arithmetic conversion is applied to the operands of
operators <CODE>&lt; > &lt;= >=</CODE>.  There is no exception if the operands
after the conversion are of integer or floating point number type.  So
the operands should be characters, integers, floating point numbers,
or strings representing integers or floating point numbers.

<H3>Arithmetic operators</H3>

<P>The following operators return integer or floating point number.
Before operator execution, implicit arithmetic conversion is made on
operands.  Binary operators <CODE>+ - * / %</CODE> denote correspondingly
integer or floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and evaluation of remainder.  Unary operator <CODE>-</CODE>
denotes arithmetic negotiation.  Unary operator <CODE>+</CODE> is given
for symmetry and it returns simply the operand after the conversion.
It can be used e.g. for conversion of a string into integer or floating
point number.

<H3>Miscellaneous operators</H3>

<P>Conditional expression is analogous to C language one.  The implicit
arithmetic conversion is made for the first expression followed by
<CODE>?</CODE>.  If the value of the expression is non zero (integer or
floating point), the second expression with preceding <CODE>:</CODE> is
evaluated and it will be the result of the condition expression.
Otherwise, the third expression is evaluated and it becomes the
result.
<P>Operator <CODE>#</CODE> can be applied to a vector or a table.  It returns
the length of the vector or elements number in the table.
<P>Operator <CODE>@</CODE> denotes concatenation of two vectors into new
vector.  Before the concatenation the implicit string conversion of
the operands is made.
<P>The remaining operators look like a function call.  Operator
<CODE>type</CODE> returns the expression type.  Never an exception
generation is possible during the operator evaluation.
<P>Operator <CODE>char</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into
character.  The first, implicit integer conversion is applied to the
operand.  The operand should be an integer after the conversion.
Otherwise, exception <CODE>optype</CODE> will be generated.  The integer
is transformed into character with the corresponding code.  If the
code is too big to be a character or negative, exception
<CODE>erange</CODE> is generated.
<P>Operator <CODE>int</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into integer.
The first, implicit integer conversion is applied to the operand.  The
operand should be an integer after the conversion.  Otherwise,
exception <CODE>optype</CODE> will be generated.  If the code is too big
to be an integer, exception <CODE>erange</CODE> is generated.
<P>Operator <CODE>float</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into
floating-point number.  The first, implicit arithmetic conversion is
applied to the operand.  The operand should be an integer or a
floating-point number after the conversion.  Otherwise, exception
<CODE>optype</CODE> will be generated.  The integer is transformed into
the corresponding floating-point number.  If the code is too big or
small to be a floating-point number, exception <CODE>erange</CODE> is
generated.
<P>Operator <CODE>vector</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into vector.
The first, implicit string conversion is applied to the operand.  The
optional second expression defines format used only for the string
conversion of a character, an integer, a floating point number, or a
string.  The second parameter value should be a string after implicit
string conversion.  The format should not be given for a table.  The
first operand should be a table or a vector after the conversion.  The
table is transformed into new vector which consists of pairs (one pair
for each element of the table).  The first element of the pair is key
of the corresponding element, the second one is the element itself.
The order of the pairs in the result vector is undefined.
<P>Operator <CODE>table</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into table.
The first, string conversion is applied to the operand.  The operand
should be a vector or a table after the conversion.  The vector is
transformed into new table whose elements equal to the vector elements
have integer keys equal to the corresponding vector indexes.
<P>If the operand of operator <CODE>func</CODE> is an block instance of body
of a function, it returns the corresponding function.  Otherwise, it
returns value <B>nil</B>.  The operator never generates exception.
<P>If the operand of operator <CODE>thread</CODE> is a thread, it returns the
corresponding thread-function.  Otherwise, it returns value
<B>nil</B>.  The operator never generates exception.
<P>If the operand of operator <CODE>class</CODE> is an object, it returns the
object class.  Otherwise, it returns value <B>nil</B>.  The operator
never generates exception.
