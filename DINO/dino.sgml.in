History
==========
  Apr 29, 2001.  Documentation of all object corresponding to Earley's
	         parser was added.

  May 05, 2001.  Semantics of private declaration is changed slightly.
                 Early, they were accessible only by separate
                 identifier.  Now they are accessible inside their
                 scope.  In other words, they can be accessible by `.'
                 or `->' inside the scope.

                 Adding profile option -p.

                 Adding IEEE standard floating point arithmetic.
                 
                 Declaration block friends.

  Jun 22, 2001.  Function rcount is added.

  Jul 19, 2001.  Functions getf and fgetf have been added.

  Jun 23, 2001.  Function gmatch is added, rcount is removed.

  Jun 25, 2001.  Operators char, int, float are added.

  Sep 25, 2001.  Vector conversion with format.  New function rev.
                 del, ins, insv now return the vector.  getln
                 with parameter.

<sect>Introduction
<p>
DINO is high level scripting dynamic-typed language.  DINO is designed
taking such design principles as simplicity, uniformity, and
expressiveness into account.  Dino is oriented on the same domain of
applications as famous scripting languages Perl, TCL, Python.  The
most of programmers know C language.  Therefore Dino aims to look like
C language where it is possible.  Dino is an object oriented language
with garbage collection.  Dino has possibilities of parallelism
description and exceptions handling.  Dino is an extensible language
with possibility of dynamic load of libraries written on other
languages.  The high level structures of Dino are
    <itemize>
    <item>heterogenous extensible vectors
    <item>extensible associative tables with possibilities of deleting
      table elements
    <item>objects
    </itemize>

Originally, Dino was used in russian graphics company ANIMATEK (<url
url="http://www.animatek.com" name="Animatek">) for description of
movement of dinosaurs in an project.  It has been considerably
redesigned and implemented with the aid of COCOM tool set.
<p>
This document is not a programmer's tutorial.  It is concise
description of language DINO and can be used as programmer's
reference.

<sect>Syntax
<p>

An extended Backus-Naur Formalism (EBNF) is used to describe the
syntax of Dino.  Alternatives are separated by <tt>|</tt>.  Brackets
<tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> denote optionality of the enclosed
expression, and braces <tt>{</tt> and <tt>}</tt> denote repetition
(zero or more times).  Parentheses <tt>(</tt> and <tt>)</tt> are used
for grouping EBNF construction containing alternatives inside them as
one construction.
<p>
Terminal symbols denoting class of terminals (e.g. identifier) consist
of only upper-case letters (e.g. IDENT).  Remaining terminal symbols
either start with a lower-case letter (e.g. keyword else), or are
denoted by ASCII character sequences in double quotes
(e.g. <tt>"=="</tt>).  Non-terminal symbols start with an upper-case
letter and contain at least one lower-case letter
(e.g. FormalParameters).


<sect>Vocabulary and Representation
<p>
Wherever it is possible, we use also EBNF for description of lexical
symbols through ASCII set characters.  Otherwise, we use natural
language sentences in <tt><</tt> and <tt>></tt>.  Lexical symbols are
identifiers, numbers, character constants, strings, operators,
delimiters, and comments.  White characters (blanks and line breaks)
must not occur within the symbols (except in comments, and blanks in
strings).  White characters are ignored unless they are essential to
separate two consecutive lexical symbols.  Upper- and lower-case
letters are considered to be distinct.
     <enum>
     <item><em>Identifier</em> is sequence of letters and digits starting
        with a letter.  Underline is believed to be a letter for identifier.
<tscreen><verb>
          Ident = Letter {Letter | Digit}

          Letter = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j"
                 | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t"
                 | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
                 | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J"
                 | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T"
                 | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"
                 | "_"

          OctalDigit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7"

          Digit = OctalDigit | "8" | "9"
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          line  line2  next_line  NextLine
</verb></tscreen>
     <item><em>Numbers</em> are (unsigned) decimal integer or floating point
        numbers.  Numbers start with a digit.  Flag of floating point
        number is presence of decimal point <tt>.</tt> or exponent in the
        number.
<tscreen><verb>
          Number = Integer | FloatingPointNumber

          Integer = Digit {Digit}

          FloatingPointNumber = Digit {Digit} "." { Digit } [Exponent]
                              | Digit {Digit} [Exponent]

          Exponent = ("e" | "E") [ "+" | "-" ] Digit { Digit }
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          10
          100.
          1e2
          100.0E+0
</verb></tscreen>
     <item>Dino <em>character constant</em> denotes an ASCII
        character.  The following sequences starting with backslash
        have special meaning inside Dino character constant:
          <itemize>
          <item><tt><bf>\a</bf>    -</tt> ASCII character alert
          <item><tt><bf>\b</bf>    -</tt> ASCII character backspace
          <item><tt><bf>\f</bf>    -</tt> ASCII character form feed
          <item><tt><bf>\n</bf>    -</tt> ASCII character new line
          <item><tt><bf>\r</bf>    -</tt> ASCII character carriage return
          <item><tt><bf>\t</bf>    -</tt> ASCII character horizontal tab
          <item><tt><bf>\v</bf>    -</tt> ASCII character vertical tab
          <item><tt><bf>\code</bf> -</tt> ASCII character with given octal code
          <item><tt><bf>\char</bf> -</tt> ASCII character char for all remaining characters
          </itemize>
        To denote single quote mark use sequence <tt>\'</tt>.  Double
        quote mark can be represented either by <tt>\"</tt> or simply
        by <tt>"</tt>.  To represent backslash inside the character
        constant, use two ASCII backslashes.
<tscreen><verb>
          Character = "'" Char "'"

          Char = <any ASCII character except for the single quote ',
                  backslash \, or line break>
               | SimpleEscapeSequence
               | OctalEscapeSequence

          EscapeSequence = <one of  \'  \"  \\  \a  \b  \f  \n  \r  \t  \v>

          OctalEscapeSequence = "\" OctalDigit [ OctalDigit [ OctalDigit ] ]
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          'a'  '\''  '\\'  '\12'  '"'
</verb></tscreen>
     <item><em>Strings</em> are sequence of ASCII characters enclosed
        in double quote marks. There are the same sequences of ASCII
        characters with special meaning as in character constant.  To
        denote double quote mark use sequence <tt>\"</tt>.  Single
        quote mark can be represented either by <tt>\'</tt> or simply
        by <tt>'</tt>.  To represent backslash inside the character
        constant, use two ASCII backslashes.
<tscreen><verb>
          String = """ {Char} """
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          "This is Dino"  "Don't worry\n"
</verb></tscreen>
     <item>Remaining essential symbols are called <em>operators</em> and
        <em>delimiters</em>.  Operators are used for forming expressions,
        delimiters are used for forming syntax constructions.  There
        is special kind of operators and delimiters which look like
        identifiers containing only lower-case letters.  They are
        reserved identifiers (keywords).  Keywords can not be used on
        the place of identifier.
<tscreen><verb>
          OperatorOrAndDelimeter = "?" | ":" | "|" | "||" | "&" | "&&" | "^"
	                         | "==" | "!=" | "===" | "!==" | "<" | ">"
			         | "<=" | ">=" | "<<" | ">>" | ">>>" | "@"
	                         | "+" | "-" | "/" | "*" | "%" | "!" | "+"
                                 | "-" | "~" | "#" | "(" | ")" | "[" | "]"
	                         | "{" | "}" | "->" | "." | "," | ";" | "="
	                         | "*=" | "/=" | "%=" | "+=" | "-="
                                 | "@=" | "<<=" | ">>=" | ">>>=" | "&="
	                         | "^=" | "|=" | "++" | "--" | "..."
                                 | Keyword

          Keyword = "break" | "catch" | "char" | "class" | "continue"
	          | "else" | "ext" | "extern"
                  | "final" | "float" | "for" | "friend" | "func"
                  | "hide" | "hideblock" | "if" | "in" | "int"
                  | "new" | "nil" | "public" | "private" | "return"
	          | "table" | "thread" | "throw" | "try" | "type"
                  | "var" | "vector" | "wait"
</verb></tscreen>
     <item><em>Comments</em> are considered analogous to blanks on syntax level
        of the program.  There are two type of comments.  The first
        comment is arbitrary character sequences starting with <tt>/*</tt>
        and finishing by <tt>*/</tt>.  The second type comment starts with
        <tt>//</tt> and finishes with the first line break or with the end of
        file.
<tscreen><verb>
          Comment = "/*" <arbitrary char. sequence not containing pair */> "*/"
                  | "//" <arbitrary char. sequence finishing on line break>
</verb></tscreen>
     </enum>


<sect>Declarations and Scope Rules
<p>
Dino program has block structure.  Each block introduces a new
identifier scope.  Block consists of executive statements and
declarations and may contains nested blocks.  Each identifier used in a
program should be declared in a declaration of the program, unless it
is a predeclared identifier.
<tscreen><verb>
          Block = "{"  StmtList "}"

          StmtList = { Stmt }
       	
          Stmt = ExecutiveStmt
               | Declaration
</verb></tscreen>
Declaring identifier, you also specify certain permanent properties of
an declaration, such as whether it is a variable, a function, or a
class.  The identifier is then used to refer to the associated
declaration (more correctly with the declaration instance).
<tscreen><verb>
          Declaration = VarDeclarations
                      | AccessClause
                      | ExternDeclarations
                      | FuncClassExtDeclaration
                      | IncludeDeclaration
</verb></tscreen>
The scope of an declaration is textually from the start (not from the
point of declaration!) to the end of the block to which the declaration
belongs and hence to which the declaration is local.  It excludes the
scopes of declarations with the same identifier which are in nested
blocks.  In a block, maximum one declaration of the same identifier is
possible.
<p>
It is important to understand notion of instantiation of the
declaration.  This notion reflects program execution not static
structure of program.  An instance exists in <em>context</em>.
Actually, context is execution environment consisting of covering
block instances or/and class objects.  A new instance of the block is
created when the block execution starts.  There may be more one
instance of the same block, e.g. when the block is a function or class
body (block instance in this case is a class object), or when the
block is executed on different threads (parallel execution branches)
or when there is a reference to block instance after its execution.
When new instance of the block starts, all the block declarations are
instantiated too.  For a variable declaration, it means new instance
of variable is created in given context.  For a function or class
declaration, it means that the function or class is bound to given
context.
<p>
        Examples: 
          The following program illustrates case when a reference to
          block instance exists after its execution.  The program outputs
          result 8. 
<tscreen><verb>
          var i, f;
        
          for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            if (i % 4 == 0)
              {
                var j = i;
                func r () {return j;}
                f = r;
              }
          putln (f ());
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
Declaration is either private or public.  Private declaration is
accessible only inside the declaration scope or inside function or
class which are declared as friend in the declaration block.  Public
declaration instance is accessible always when association (see below)
of the identifier is successful.  By default, (instances of)
declarations in class block are public.  In all other places, the
(instances of) declarations are private by default.  The following
constructions are used for declaring identifier public, private, or as
friend:
<tscreen><verb>
          AccessClause = (public | private | friend) AccessList ";"

          AccessList = IDENT { "," IDENT }
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          public param1, param2;
          private call_count;
          friend class2;
</verb></tscreen>
Association of identifier and the declaration instance are performed
by the following rules:
     <itemize>
     <item>The corresponding declaration instance are searched for
       separate identifier occurrence in the instance of the block in
       which the identifier occurs.  If the previous failed, the
       declaration is searched in covering block instance of the
       current block instance.  And so on.
     <item>Declaration instance for identifier in the following
       construction
<tscreen><verb>
       designator.identifier
</verb></tscreen>
       is searched in block instance (e.g. in a class object) whose
       value is in the designator.  If the designator is a class
       object, its context is a class object, and the search failed,
       the search is continued in the covering class object etc.
       Exception <tt>accessop</tt> occurs if the declaration is not
       found with such identifier, or the declaration is private and
       the construction is not in the declaration scope and not
       inside friend of the declaration scope.
     <item>Declaration instance for identifier whose name is
       expression value in the following construction
<tscreen><verb>
       *(expression)
</verb></tscreen>
       is searched in the same way as a separate identifier.
       Exception <tt>accessop</tt> occurs if there is no instance of
       declaration with such identifier in covering block instances.
     <item>Declaration for identifier in the following construction
<tscreen><verb>
       (expression)->identifier
</verb></tscreen>
       is searched in analogous way as in construction
       <tt>designator.identifier</tt> in block instance which is
       value of the variable whose name is given by the expression.
       The variable is searched in the same way as in construction
       <tt>*(expression)</tt>.  Exception <tt>accessop</tt> occurs if
       there is no variable instance with given name in covering
       block instances, there is no instance of the declaration with
       such identifier in given context (the variable value), or the
       declaration is private and the construction is not in the
       declaration scope.
     </itemize>
The following identifiers are predeclared on the top level (in implicit
block covering all program).  They are described in more detail in the
report later.

<sect1>Variable Declarations
<p>
Dino is imperative language. In other words it has <em>variables</em>
which are named containers of values.  Variable can contain any value.
This means that DINO is a dynamic-type language.  Declaration of
variable also may define initial value of the variable.  Assigning of
the initial value to the variable instance is made after execution of
the previous statements of the block.  By default initial value of
variables is special value <bf>nil</bf>.  The value of variable can
not be changed after its initialization if its declaration contains
keyword <bf>final</bf>.
<tscreen><verb>
          VarDeclarations = var  VarParList ";"

          VarParList = VarPar { "," VarPar }
       	
          VarPar = [final] IDENT [ "="  Expr]
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          var i = 0, j, k;
          var final constant = 10, final nil_constant, l;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>External Declarations
<p>
Dino permits to use functions written on other languages, e.g. C.  The
functions should have special prototypes and can have to access to
DINO standard procedural interface (SPI).  Dino can also have access
to variables of special type declared in source code on other
language.  The details of such features implementation and DINO SPI
are not described here (some details are given in appendix B).  As
rule, the external functions and variables will be implemented as
dynamically loaded libraries.  This is powerful instrument of DINO
extension.  The external functions, variables are declared after
keyword <bf>extern</bf>.  The external function identifier is followed
by <tt>()</tt>.  All external declarations (e.g. in different blocks)
with the same identifier refer for the same external function or
variable.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExternDeclarations = extern  ExternItem { "," ExternItem } ";"

          ExternItem = IDENT 
                     | IDENT  "(" ")"
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          extern function (), variable;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Functions, Classes, Extensions
<p>
Function/class declaration consists of a function/class header and a
function/class block (body).  The header specifies the function
identifier and <em>formal parameters</em>.  Function can return the
result with the aid of statement <em>return</em>.  If the result value
after keyword return is absent or return statement is absent or is not
executed, the function returns <bf>nil</bf> by default.  Class call
returns an object of the class which can be considered as a block
instance of the class body.  Return-statement for classes must be
without result.  <em>Thread-functions</em> are analogous to general
functions.  The difference is in that a new execution <em>thread</em>
is created during the thread-function call, return-statement inside
thread-function must be without an expression, and thread-function
returns the corresponding (execution) thread.  The execution thread
finishes when the corresponding thread block finishes.  Execution
threads are executed parallelly.  Originally only one thread (so
called <em>main thread</em>) exists in DINO program.
<p>
The formal parameters are considered to be declared in function/class
block and to be initialized by values of <em>actual parameters</em>
during call of the function/class.  The function can be called with
any numbers of <em>actual parameters</em>.  If the number of actual
parameters are less than the formal parameters number, the remaining
formal parameters are initialized by special value <bf>nil</bf>.
Otherwise if the number of actual parameters are more than the formal
parameters number, the remaining actual parameter values are ignored.
In order to process all actual parameters, you should place
<tt>...</tt> at the end of list of formal parameter declarations.
That means that formal parameter with identifier <tt>args</tt> will be
declared implicitly.  The value of the parameter will be vector whose
elements will be the remaining actual parameter values.  If the number
of actual parameters are less or equal to the number of formal
parameters (not taking implicit parameter <tt>args</tt> into account),
the value of <tt>args</tt> will be empty vector.  The formal parameter
can be initialized by default value in way analogous to variable
initialization.  The initialization is made only when the
corresponding actual parameter value is <bf>nil</bf>.
<p>
Instead of inheritance usually used in object oriented languages, Dino
supports <em>extension</em>.  This feature permits to modify
function/class behaviour.  All inside extension bodies is inserted at
the end of body of function/class declared with the same identifier in
the same block in the same order as the extensions are placed in the
block.  Function/class declared as <em>final</em> can not be extended.

<sect>Expressions
<p>
Expressions are constructs denoting rules of computation of a value
from other values by the application of <em>operators</em>.
Expressions consist of <em>operands</em> and operators.  Parentheses
may be used to express specific associations of operators and
operands.  Dino is a dynamic-typed language.  That means that variable
can store any Dino value.

<sect1>Types and Values
<p>
All Dino values are <em>the first class values</em>, i.e. they can be
assigned to a variable, can be passed as a parameter of
function/class, and can be returned by functions.  Operators require
operands whose values are of given types and return value of the
result type.  The most of values have a represention in Dino.  When a
value representation is encountered in expression during the
expression evaluation, the new value is generated.
<p>
There are values of <em>structured types</em>, i.e. values which are
built from other values.  The value of a structured type may be
<em>mutable</em> or <em>immutable</em>.  Value or sub-value of mutable
value can be changed.  Immutable value can not be changed after its
generation.  You can make mutable value an immutable by applying
operator <tt>final</tt> as side effect.  In all cases, the operator
returns the operand value as the result.  If you try to change
immutable value, exception <tt>immutable</tt> is generated.  You can
make new mutable value as side effect of applying operator
<tt>new</tt>.  The operator returns new value equal to the operand
value.
<tscreen><verb>
          Expr = final  Expr
               | new  Expr
</verb></tscreen>
Structured value types are also <em>shared value types</em>.  This
notion means that if two or more different variables (array elements
or table elements or keys) refer for the same value and the value is
changed through one variable, the value which is referred through
other variables is changed too.  There is no difference between notion
"the same value" and notion "equal values" for non-shared type values.
For the shared type operands, the equality means that the operands
have the same structure (e.g. vectors with the same length) and the
corresponding element values are the same.
<p>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          new 5
          new ['a', 'b', 'c']
          new "abc"
          new {"key0" : 10, "key1" : 20}
          final 5
          final ['a', 'b', 'c']
          final "abc"
          final {"key0" : 10, "key1" : 20}
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
Dino has the following types of values:
          <itemize>
          <item>special value <em>nil</em>.  This is default value of
            variables when the corresponding block starts.  The value
            is represented by keyword <bf>nil</bf>.
<tscreen><verb>
                 Expr = nil
</verb></tscreen>
          <item><em>character</em> which represents ASCII characters.
            The representation see <tt>Character</tt> in section
            <em>Vocabulary and Representation</em>.
<tscreen><verb>
                 Expr = CHARACTER
</verb></tscreen>
          <item><em>integer</em>.  Its representation see
            <tt>Integer</tt> in section <em>Vocabulary and
            Representation</em>.  It is always stored as 32-bit
            integer value.
<tscreen><verb>
                 Expr = INTEGER
</verb></tscreen>
          <item><em>floating point number</em>.  Its representation
            see <tt>FloatingPointNumber</tt> in section
            <em>Vocabulary and Representation</em>.  It is always
            stored as IEEE double (64-bit) floating point value.
<tscreen><verb>
                 Expr = FLOATINGPOINTNUMBER
</verb></tscreen>
          <item><em>vector</em>.  This is a structured shared type
            value.  Vector value is represented by list of values (or
            expressions) in brackets with optional repetitions of the
            vector elements followed by <tt>:</tt>.  The repetition
            value is conversed into integer value by default.  If the
            repetition value after this is not of integer, exception
            <tt>optype</tt> is generated. If the repetition value is
            negative or zero, the element value will be absent in the
            vector.  Elements of vector are accessed by their
            indexes.  Indexes always starts with 0.  Vectors in Dino
            are heterogenous, i.e. elements of a vector may be of
            different types.  String represents immutable vector
            whose all elements are characters in the string.
            Elements of mutable vectors can be added to or removed
            from the vector (see predefined functions <em>ins, insv,
            del</em>).
<tscreen><verb>
                 Expr = "["  ElistPartsList "]"

               [3 : 'a', 'b']
               [3.0 : 'a', 'b']
               ["3" : 'a', 'b']
               ['a', 10, 10.0, "abcd", {}]
               []
</verb></tscreen>
          <item><em>table</em>.  This is a structured shared type
            value.  Table value is represented by list of key values
            (expression values) in figure parentheses <tt>{</tt> and
            <tt>}</tt> with optional element values with preceding
            <tt>:</tt>.  By default element value is equal to
            <bf>nil</bf>.  It is not possible to have elements with
            equal keys in a table.  If it is not true in a table
            constructor, exception <tt>keyvalue</tt> is generated.
            Elements of tables are accessed by their keys.  Elements
            of mutable tables can be added to or removed from the
            table correspondingly by assigning value and with the
            aid function <em>del</em>.  The side effect of table
            constructor execution is that the keys become immutable.

          <item><em>function</em>.  Its value is represented by
            function designator.  It is important to remember
            that the function is bound to a context.
          <item><em>thread-function</em>.  Its value is represented by
            thread-function designator.  It is important to remember
            that the thread-function is bound to a context.
          <item><em>class</em>.  Its value is represented by
            class designator.  It is important to remember
            that the class is bound to a context.
          <item><em>block instance</em>.  There is no Dino
            representation of such values.
          <item><em>thread</em>.  There is no Dino representation of
            such values.  Thread value is generated by calling
            a thread-function.
          <item><em>object</em>(class instance).  This is a structured
            shared type value.  There is no Dino representation of
            such values.  Objects are generated by calling classes.
          <item><em>hide value</em>.  Hide value can not be generated
            in Dino code.  They are generated by external functions.
          <item><em>hide block</em>.  This value is analogous to hide
            value.  The differences are in that the size of a hide
            value is constrained by C program pointer.  The size of
            hideblock value has no such constraint.  Also hideblock
            is of shared type.
          <item><em>type</em>.  The value of such types are returned
            by special operator <tt>type (expression)</tt>.

<sect1>Designators
<p>
There is special Dino construction called <em>designator</em>.
Designator refers for an vector or table element or for an
declaration.  If designator refers for vector or table element or for
variable declaration, it can stand in left hand side of assignment
statement.  If the designator stands in an expression, the
corresponding value is used (vector/table element value, variable
value, function, thread-function, or class).
<tscreen><verb>
          Expr = Designator
</verb></tscreen>
Designator referring for a vector element has the following syntax
<tscreen><verb>
          Designator = DesignatorOrCall "["  Expr "]"

          DesignatorOrCall = Designator
                           | Call
</verb></tscreen>
The value of the construction before the brackets must be a vector.
Otherwise, the exception <tt>indexop</tt> is generated.  The value of
expression in the brackets (so called <em>index</em>) is conversed to
integer.  If it is not possible, exception <tt>indextype</tt> is
generated.  If index is negative or greater or equal to the vector
length, the exception <tt>indexvalue</tt> is generated.  The value of
the designator will be the vector element value with given index (the
indexes starts with zero).
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          vect [1]
          vect ["1"]
          vect [1.0]
</verb></tscreen>
Designator referring for a table element has the following syntax
<tscreen><verb>
          Designator = DesignatorOrCall "{"  Expr "}"
</verb></tscreen>
The value of the construction before the figure brackets must be a
table.  Otherwise, the exception <tt>keyop</tt> is generated.  The
value of expression in the figure brackets is called <em>key</em>.
The value of the designator will be the table element value with key
which is equal to given key.  If the element with given key is absent
in the table, exception <tt>keyvalue</tt> is generated.
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          tab {'c'}
          tab {10}
          tab {"1"}
          tab {1.0}
</verb></tscreen>
The remaining forms of designator refer for a declaration.  See
section <em>Declarations and Scope Rules</em> describing how they

<sect1>Call
<p>
One form of expression is call of function, thread-function, or class.
The value of designator before the actual parameters should be
function, thread-function, or class.  Otherwise, exception
<tt>callop</tt> is generated.  Instance of block corresponding to the
body of the function, thread-function, or class is created.  The
actual parameter values are assigned to the corresponding formal
parameters.  If the corresponding function, thread-function, or class
has no default formal parameter <tt>args</tt> (see section
<em>Declarations</em>), the remaining actual parameter values are
ignored.  Otherwise, vector whose elements are the remaining parameter
values are created and assigned to parameter <tt>args</tt>.  If there
is no corresponding actual parameter for a formal parameter, the
default parameter value (see section <em>Declarations</em>) or value
<bf>nil</bf> are assigned to the formal parameter.  Then statements in
the block are executed.  If it is call of a thread-function, new
execution thread is created, and the statements of the block is
executed in the new thread.  The value of call of the thread-function
is the corresponding thread.  It is returned before starting execution
of the statements in the new thread.
<p>
Execution of the body is finished by achieving the block end or by
execution of return-statement.  Finishing of thread-function results
in finishing the corresponding thread.  The return-statement in
thread-function or in class should be without an expression.  The call
of class returns the created object.  Function call returns value of
the expression in the executed return-statement.  Otherwise, the
function call returns value <bf>nil</bf>.

<sect1>Operators
<p>
Expressions consist of operands and operators.  Order in which
operators are executed in expression is defined by their
<em>priority</em> and <em>associativity</em> of operators.  That means
that expression <tt>a op1 b op2 c</tt> when operators <tt>op2</tt> has
higher priority than <tt>op1</tt> is analogous to <tt>a op1 (b op2
b)</tt>.  Dino operators have the analogous priorities as ones in C
language.  The following Dino operators are placed in their priority
(the higher line on which the operator is place, the higher its
priority).
<tscreen><verb>
          !  #  ~  final  new
          *  /  %
          +  -
          @
          <<  >>  >>>
          <  >  <=  >=
          ==  !=  ===  !==
          &
          ^
          |
          in
          &&
          ||
          :
          ?
</verb></tscreen>
All binary operators have left associativity in Dino.  That means that
expression <tt>a op1 b op2 c</tt> when operators <tt>op1</tt> and
<tt>op2</tt> have the same priority is analogous to <tt>(a op1 b) op2
b</tt>.  Parentheses may be used to express specific associations of
operators and operands.
<tscreen><verb>
          Expr = "(" Expr ")"
</verb></tscreen>
The most of Dino operators require that the operands to be of given
types.  If an operand is not given type, the conversion of it into the
type may be made.  If after the possible conversion the operands are
not still of necessary types, exception <tt>optype</tt> is generated
(when something special about exceptions in this case is not
mentioned).  The following conversion may be made by default:
    <itemize>
    <item><em>Integer conversion</em>.  If the operand is a character,
      its code becomes integer.  If the operand is a floating point
      number, its fractional part is thrown away and integral part
      becomes integer.  If the operand is a vector of characters, the
      corresponding string is believed to be decimal representation
      of integer and is conversed into the corresponding integer.  If
      the corresponding string is not a correct integer
      representation, the result is undefined.  If the corresponding
      string represents an integer whose representation requires more
      32 bits, exception <tt>erange</tt> may be generated.  In all
      remaining cases the result of conversion coincide with the
      operand.
    <item><em>Arithmetic conversion</em>.  Analogous to integer
      conversion except for that conversion float pointing number ->
      integer is not made and if the string represents floating point
      number (i.e. contains exponent or fraction), the result will be
      the corresponding floating point number instead of integer.
      Additionally if the operand is in a non-short circuit binary
      operator (non logical operators) and another operand is
      floating point number after the conversion, the first operand
      is conversed into floating point number too.  Analogously if
      the result is an integer which can not be represented by 32-bit
      integer or the result is an floating point number not
      represented by IEEE double, the exception <tt>erange</tt> may
      be generated.
    <item><em>String conversion</em>.  If the operand is a character,
      the result will be a new string (immutable vector of
      characters) with one element which is the character.  If the
      operand is an integer or a floating point number, the result
      will be new string of characters which is a decimal string
      representation of the number.
    </itemize>

<sect2>Logical operators
<p>
Logical operators produce integer result 1 which means <em>true</em>
or 0 which means <em>false</em>.  Logical `or' <tt>||</tt> and logical
`and' <tt>&&</tt> are <em>short circuit</em> operators.  That means
that the second operand is evaluated depending on the result of the
first operand.  When the operands of the operators are evaluated, the
arithmetic conversion is made.
<p>
If the first result of logical `or' is nonzero (integer or floating
point), the result will be 1.  Otherwise, the second operand is
evaluated.  If the second operand is nonzero, the result will be 1.
Otherwise, the result will be 0.
<p>
If the first result of logical `and' is zero (integer or floating
point), the result will be 0.  Otherwise, the second operand is
evaluated.  If the second operand is nonzero, the result will be 1.
Otherwise, the result will be 0.
<p>
Logical negotiation `!' makes impilict integer conversion of the
operand.  If the operand is zero (integer or floating point), the
result will be 1.  Otherwise, the result will be 0.
<p>
Operator <tt>in</tt> checks that there is an element with given key
(the first operand) in given table (the second operand).  If the
element is in the table, the result will be 1.  Otherwise the result
will be 0.  If the second operand is not a table, exception
<tt>keyop</tt> is generated.
<tscreen><verb>
          Expr = Expr "||"  Expr
               | Expr "&&"  Expr
               | Expr in  Expr
               | "!"  Expr
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          !(type (i) == int && type (a) == table && i >= 0 && i < #a)
          k in t && t {k} == 0
          0.0  || another_try
          0  || another_try
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Bit operators
<p>
The following operators work on integers (implicit integer conversion
is made) and return integer result.  Operators <tt>| ^ & ~</tt>
denotes correspondingly bit or, bit exclusive or, bit and, and bit
negotiation of 32-bit integers.
<p>
Operators <tt><< >>> >></tt> denote correspondingly logical left bit
shift, logical right bit shift, and arithmetic (with sign extension)
right bit shift of given number (the first operand) on given number
bits (the second operand).  The value of the second operand must be
non-negative.  Otherwise the result is undefined.
<tscreen><verb>
          Expr = Expr "|"  Expr
               | Expr "^"  Expr
               | Expr "&"  Expr 
               | Expr "<<"  Expr
               | Expr ">>"  Expr
               | Expr ">>>"  Expr
               | "~"  Expr
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          (i >> shift) & mask
          i & ~mask | (value << shift) & mask
          i >>> 2
          i << 2
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Comparison operators
<p>
All comparison operators return a logical value (integer 0 which
means false or integer 1 which means true).
<p>
Operator equality <tt>==</tt> and inequality <tt>!=</tt> may make some
conversion of the operands.  If one of the two operands is string,
then the string conversion is applied to another operand before the
comparison.  Otherwise, the standard arithmetic conversion is applied
to the operands.  The operators do not generate exceptions (but the
conversions may).  The operands are equal if they have the same type
and equal values (see section <em>Types and Values</em>).
<p>
Operators identity <tt>===</tt> and unidentity <tt>!==</tt> returns 1
if the operands have the same value or 0 otherwise.  The operators never
generates exceptions.
<p>
By default the arithmetic conversion is applied to the operands of
operators <tt>< > <= >=</tt>.  There is no exception if the operands
after the conversion are of integer or floating point number type.  So
the operands should be characters, integers, floating point numbers,
or strings representing integers or floating point numbers.
<tscreen><verb>
          Expr = Expr "=="  Expr  
               | Expr "!="  Expr

               | Expr ">="  Expr 
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          10 == 10
          10 === 10
          10 == 10.0
          10 !== 10.0
          10 <= 'c'
          p != nil
          'c' == "c"
          10 < "20.0"
          [10, 20] == [10, 20]
          [10, 20] !== [10, 20]
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Arithmetic operators
<p>
The following operators return integer or floating point number.
Before operator execution, implicit arithmetic conversion is made on
operands.  Binary operators <tt>+ - * / %</tt> denote correspondingly
integer or floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and evaluation of remainder.  Unary operator <tt>-</tt>
denotes arithmetic negotiation.  Unary operator <tt>+</tt> is given
for symmetry and it returns simply the operand after the conversion.
It can be used e.g. for conversion of a string into integer or floating
point number.
<tscreen><verb>
          Expr = Expr "+"  Expr
               | Expr "-"  Expr
               | Expr "*"  Expr
               | Expr "/"  Expr
               | Expr "%"  Expr
               | "+"  Expr
               | "-"  Expr
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          +"0"
          +"10."
          +"1e1"
          -i
          (value + m - 1) / m * m
          index % bound 
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Miscellaneous operators
<p>
Conditional expression is analogous to C language one.  The implicit
arithmetic conversion is made for the first expression followed by
<tt>?</tt>.  If the value of the expression is non zero (integer or
floating point), the second expression with preceding <tt>:</tt> is
evaluated and it will be the result of the condition expression.
Otherwise, the third expression is evaluated and it becomes the
result.
<p>
Operator <tt>#</tt> can be applied to a vector or a table.  It returns
the length of the vector or elements number in the table.
<p>
Operator <tt>@</tt> denotes concatenation of two vectors into new
vector.  Before the concatenation the implicit string conversion of
the operands is made.
<p>
The remaining operators look like a function call.  Operator
<tt>type</tt> returns the expression type.  Never an exception
generation is possible during the operator evaluation.
<p>
Operator <tt>char</tt> is used to conversion of a value into
character.  The first, implicit integer conversion is applied to the
operand.  The operand should be an integer after the conversion.
Otherwise, exception <tt>optype</tt> will be generated.  The integer
is transformed into character with the corresponding code.  If the
code is too big to be a character or negative, exception
<tt>erange</tt> is generated.
<p>
Operator <tt>int</tt> is used to conversion of a value into integer.
The first, implicit integer conversion is applied to the operand.  The
operand should be an integer after the conversion.  Otherwise,
exception <tt>optype</tt> will be generated.  If the code is too big
to be an integer, exception <tt>erange</tt> is generated.
<p>
Operator <tt>float</tt> is used to conversion of a value into
floating-point number.  The first, implicit arithmetic conversion is
applied to the operand.  The operand should be an integer or a
floating-point number after the conversion.  Otherwise, exception
<tt>optype</tt> will be generated.  The integer is transformed into
the corresponding floating-point number.  If the code is too big or
small to be a floating-point number, exception <tt>erange</tt> is
generated.
<p>
Operator <tt>vector</tt> is used to conversion of a value into vector.
The first, implicit string conversion is applied to the operand.  The
optional second expression defines format used only for the string
conversion of a character, an integer, a floating point number, or a
string.  The second parameter value should be a string after implicit
string conversion.  The format should not be given for a table.  The
first operand should be a table or a vector after the conversion.  The
table is transformed into new vector which consists of pairs (one pair
for each element of the table).  The first element of the pair is key
of the corresponding element, the second one is the element itself.
The order of the pairs in the result vector is undefined.
<p>
Operator <tt>table</tt> is used to conversion of a value into table.
The first, string conversion is applied to the operand.  The operand
should be a vector or a table after the conversion.  The vector is
transformed into new table whose elements equal to the vector elements
have integer keys equal to the corresponding vector indexes.
<p>
If the operand of operator <tt>func</tt> is an block instance of body
of a function, it returns the corresponding function.  Otherwise, it
returns value <bf>nil</bf>.  The operator never generates exception.
<p>
If the operand of operator <tt>thread</tt> is a thread, it returns the
corresponding thread-function.  Otherwise, it returns value
<bf>nil</bf>.  The operator never generates exception.
<p>
If the operand of operator <tt>class</tt> is an object, it returns the
object class.  Otherwise, it returns value <bf>nil</bf>.  The operator
never generates exception.

<sect>Executive statements
<p>
Statements denote actions.  There are <em>simple</em> and
<em>compound</em> statements.  Simple statements do no consists of any
parts that are statements themselves.  They are the assignment, the
procedure call, the return, the break, the continue, the throw, and
the wait statements.  Analogous to C language the last symbol of Dino
simple statement is semicolon <tt>;</tt>.  Compound statements
consists of parts that are statements themselves.  They are used to
express sequencing, exception handling, conditional, and repetitive
execution.

<sect1>Empty statement
<p>
There is also empty statement in Dino.  It denotes no action.  The
empty statement is included in Dino for convenience.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = ";"
</verb></tscreen>
        Example: Usage of empty statement in for-statement
<tscreen><verb>
          for (i = 0; a[i] == 0; i++)
            ;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Block-statement
<p>
Block-statement is simply block and can used to group statements in
one statement and/or also to describe local declarations.  How the
block is executed see in section <em>Declaration and Scope Rules</em>.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = BlockStmt

          BlockStmt = Block
</verb></tscreen>
        Example: Usage of block-statement in for-statement
<tscreen><verb>
          sum = 0;
          for (i = 0; i < #a; i++)
            {
	      var value = a[i];
              if (value > 0)
                sum += value;
            }
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Assignment statements
<p>

Assignment-statements is used to change variable values or element
values of a structured value which are referred through a designator
(see sub-section <em>Designator</em> in section <em>Expressions</em>.
The designator can not denote final variable (see section <em>Variable
Declaration</em>).  You can not change element value of immutable
value (see section <em>Types and Values</em>).  In this case exception
<tt>immutable</tt> is generated.
<p>
Simple assignment statement looks like <tt>Designator = Expr;</tt>.
That means that the expression value is assigned to variable or
element of structured type value denoted by the designator.  For
convenience of C programmers there are also Dino assignments kind of
<tt>Designator op= Expr;</tt>, <tt>Designator++;</tt>,
<tt>++Designator;</tt>, <tt>Designator--;</tt>, and
<tt>--Designator;</tt>.  They are analogous correspondingly to
<tt>Designator = Designator op Expr;</tt>, <tt>Designator = Designator
+ 1;</tt>, and <tt>Designator = Designator - 1;</tt>.  The only
difference is in that the Designator is evaluated only once not twice
as in the analogous form.  It is important to know if you have
<em>side effects</em> in the statement.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = Designator Assign  Expr ";"
                        | Designator ("++" | "--")  ";"
                        | ("++" | "--")  Designator ";"
          Assign = "="
                 | "*="
                 | "/="

                 | ">>>="
                 | "&="
                 | "^="
                 | "|="
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          v = [10, 20];
          i = 1;
          i++;
          --i;
          i *= 20
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Call-statement
<p>
Call-statement is used to call a function, a thread-function, or a
class.  It works analogous to the call in expression (see sub-section
<em>Call</em> in section <em>Types and Values</em>).  The single
difference is in that call-statement throws away the call result.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = Designator ActualParameters  ";"
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          putln ("percent=" @ percent @ "%");
          newthread ();
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>If-statement
<p>
Dino if-statement is analogous to C language one.  The first,
expression after <tt>if</tt> is evaluated and arithmetic conversion is
made to it.  The value should be an integer or a floating-point
number, otherwise exception <tt>optype</tt> is generated.  If the
value is nonzero the first statement is executed, otherwise the
statement after <tt>else</tt> is executed if any.  The problem with
<em>dangling else</em> is resolved analogous to C language --
<tt>else</tt> is associated with the last <tt>if</tt>.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = if  "(" Expr ")" Stmt [ else Stmt ]
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          if (i < 0) i = 0;
          if (i < j) return -1; else if (i > 0) return 1; else return 0;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>For-statement
<p>
Dino for-statement is analogous to C language one.  The statement is
executed in the following way.
     <enum>
     <item>Execution of the first statement in the parentheses.
     <item>The expression (<em>for-guard</em>) is evaluated and the
        implicit arithmetic conversion is made.  The value should be
        an integer or a floating point number.  If this is not true,
        exception <tt>optype</tt> is generated.
     <item>If the value of for-guard is nonzero, the body of the loop
        (the last statement) is executed.  Otherwise, the
        for-statement execution finishes.
     <item>When the body has been executed, the second statement in
        the parentheses is executed and steps 2,3,4 (one iteration) are
        repeated.
     </enum>
If the second statement is a simple statement, the statement semicolon
can be omitted.  The for-statement also can be finished by execution
of statement <tt>break</tt> in the body.  The body can be finished by
execution of statement <tt>continue</tt>.  In this case, the
for-statement execution continues with the step 4.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = for  "("  Stmt ForGuardExpr ";"  Stmt ")" Stmt

          ForGuardExpr = [Expr]
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          for (i = 0; i < 10; i++;) sum += v [i];
          for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) sum += v [i];
          for ({sum = 0; i = 0;} i < 10; i++) sum += v [i];
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Foreach-statement
<p>
This statement is used to execution of the foreach-statement body (the
statement) for all keys of table which is value of the expression.
The expression value should be a table.  If this is not true,
exception <tt>keyop</tt> is generated.  The current key value on each
iteration is assigned to the designator.  The order in which key
values are assigned on each iteration is undefined.  One iteration can
be finished with the aid of statement <tt>continue</tt> and all
foreach-statement can be finished by execution of statement
<tt>break</tt>.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = for  "("  Designator in Expr ")" Stmt
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          putln ("All table is");
          for (k in t) {
            put ("key=");
            print (k);
            put (", element=");
            println (t{k});
          }
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Break- and continue-statement
<p>
Statements <tt>break</tt> and <tt>continue</tt> are used
correspondingly to finish execution of the most nested for- or
foreach-statement covering the statement and to finish one iteration
of the body of the for- or foreach-statement.  These statement can
be used only inside of a for- or foreach-statement.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = break ";"
                        | continue ";"
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
             if (ind [i] < 0)
               continiue;
             val = v [ind[i]];
          }
          for (i in t)
            if (t{i} == elval)
              break;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Return-statement
<p>
Return-statement is used to finish execution of a function, a thread,
or class block.  The statement corresponds to the most nested
function, function-thread, or class covering the statement.  So
return-statement can be placed only in a function, a function-thread,
or a class.  Expression in return-statement can be given only for
functions.  In this case, the expression value will be value of the
function call (instead of default result value <bf>nil</bf>).
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = return  [ Expr ] ";"
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          return;
          return [10, 2:0]
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Throw-statement
<p>
This statement generates exception which is given by value of the
expression.  The expression should be an object of predeclared class
<tt>except</tt> or an object of class declared somewhere in
predeclared class <tt>except</tt>.  If this is not true, exception
<tt>optype</tt> is generated.  How exceptions are processed are
described in the following section.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = throw  Expr ";"
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          ext except {
            ext error {
              class myexcept (msg) {}
            }
          }
          throw errors.myexcept ("this is an user defined exception");
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Try-block
<p>
Exceptions can be generated by Dino interpreter when some conditions
are not satisfied, by predeclared Dino functions, by other OS
processes, by user interruptions, or by user with the aid of
throw-statement.  Actually, the exceptions are represented by an
object of predeclared class <tt>except</tt> or by an object of class
declared inside of the predeclared class <tt>except</tt>.  All
predeclared exceptions are described in section <em>Predeclared
Identifiers</em>.  To catch and to process exceptions, try-block can
be used.
<p>
When an exception is occurred, the most nested try-block which
covering the statement generating the exception or currently being
executed (when this is is generated by an OS process, by an user
interruption) is searched for.  Then, expressions in the catch list
elements are processed subsequently.  The expression value in the catch
list element being processed should be predeclared class
<tt>except</tt> or class declared inside the predeclared class
<tt>except</tt>.  If the expression being processed is a class and the
exception is an object of the class or an object of a class declared
in the class given by the expression being processed, the block
corresponding to given catch list element is executed.  If there is
not such catch expression, the most nested try-block covering the
current try-block is searched for and processing the exception is
repeated.  If there are no more such try-blocks, the program finishes
with diagnostics which is dependent on the generated exception.
<p>
Blocks corresponding to catch list elements have predeclared variable
<tt>e</tt>.  When the block execution start, the variable contains the
object representing the exception.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = TryBlockStmt

          TryBlockStmt = try Block { Catch }
       	
          Catch = catch  "(" ExceptClassList ")" Block

          ExceptClassList = Expr { "," Expr }
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          try {
            var ln;
            for (;;)
              ln = getln ();
          } catch (invcalls.eof) {
          }
          try {
            var v = [];
            v {1} = 0;
          } catch (except) {
            put ("catching and propagating up exception"); println (class (e));
            throw e;
          }
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Wait-statement
<p>
This statement is used for synchronization of different threads in
Dino program.  The expression can not contain a function,
thread-function call.  The thread in which the statement has been
executed waits until the expression value becomes nonzero.  The
expression value (after implicit arithmetic conversion) should be an
integer or a floating point number.  Otherwise exception
<tt>optype</tt> is generated.  The important thing to know how to make
synchronization is that the assignment statement without calls is
always executed as one transaction.
<tscreen><verb>
          ExecutiveStmt = wait  Expr ";"
</verb></tscreen>
        Examples:
<tscreen><verb>
          wait !empty;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Program
<p>
Dino program is simply a sequence of statements.  There is special
declaration useful for writing programs consisting of several files or
for making Dino packages.  This is include-declaration.  Before
execution of any statements all include-declarations are changed by
files whose base names given by the strings.  It is made recursively,
i.e.  the files themselves can contain other include-declarations.
There should be no infinite recursion in this.  If <bf>+</bf> is
present in the include-declaration, the file inserted in any case.
Without <bf>+</bf> the file inserted only if it has been not inserted
yet into the block of the declaration.
<tscreen><verb>
          Program = StmtList

          IncludeDeclaration = include ["+"] STRING ";"

<sect>Predeclared identifiers
<p>
Dino has a lot of predeclared identifiers.  Section <em>Declarations
and Scope Rules</em> contains them in alphanumeric order.  Here they
are described according the declaration category which they belongs
to.

<sect1>Predeclared variables
<p>
Dino has some predeclared variables which contain useful information
or can be used to control behaviour of Dino interpreter.

<sect2>Arguments and environment
<p>
To access Dino program arguments and environment, the following
variables can be used.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>argv</tt>.  The variable value is immutable vector
       whose elements are strings (immutable vectors of characters)
       representing arguments of Dino program (see implementation).
     <item><tt>env</tt>.  The variable value is immutable table whose
       elements are strings (immutable vectors of characters)
       representing values of environment variables whose names are
       the keys of the table.
     </itemize>

<sect2>Threads
<p>
To access some information about threads in Dino program, the
following variables can be used.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>main_thread</tt>.  The variable value is the main
       thread.  When Dino program starts, there is only one thread
       which is called <em>the main thread</em>.
     <item><tt>curr_thread</tt>.  The variable value is thread in
       which you get the variable value.
     </itemize>
All these variables are final, so you can not change their values.

<sect2>Exceptions
<p>
When it is necessary to create an exception which is a object of class
declared inside class <tt>except</tt> or when it is necessary to refer
for a class inside class <tt>except</tt>, the following variables can
be used.  Instead of typing <tt>catch (except().signal().sigint)</tt>,
you could type <tt>catch (signals.sigint)</tt>.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>excepts</tt>.  The variable value is an object of class
       <tt>except</tt>.
     <item><tt>errors</tt>.  The variable value is an object of class
       <tt>excepts.error</tt>.
     <item><tt>signals</tt>.  The variable value is an object of class
       <tt>errors.signal</tt>.
     <item><tt>invops</tt>.  The variable value is an object of class
       <tt>errors.invop</tt>.
     <item><tt>invindexes</tt>.  The variable value is an object of
       class <tt>errors.invindex</tt>.
     <item><tt>invkeys</tt>.  The variable value is an object of class
       <tt>errors.invkey</tt>.
     <item><tt>invcalls</tt>.  The variable value is an object of
       class <tt>errors.invcall</tt>.
     <item><tt>syserrors</tt>.  The variable value is an object of
       class <tt>invcalls.syserror</tt>.
     <item><tt>systemcalls</tt>.  The variable value is an object of
       class <tt>invcalls.systemcall</tt>.
     <item><tt>invparsers</tt>.  The variable value is an object of
       class <tt>invcalls.invparser</tt>.
     <item><tt>invregexps</tt>.  The variable value is an object of
       class <tt>invcalls.invregexp</tt>.
     <item><tt>invexterns</tt>.  The variable value is an object of
       class <tt>invcalls.invextern</tt>.
     <item><tt>invaccesses</tt>.  The variable value is an object of
       class <tt>errors.invaccess</tt>.
     </itemize>
All these variables are final, so you can not change their values.

<sect2>Files
<p>
To output something into standard streams or to input something from
the standard input stream, the following variables can be used.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>stdin</tt>.  The variable value is an object of class
       <tt>file</tt> which corresponds to standard input stream.
     <item><tt>stdout</tt>.  The variable value is an object of class
       <tt>file</tt> which corresponds to standard output stream.
     <item><tt>stderr</tt>.  The variable value is an object of class
       <tt>file</tt> which corresponds to standard error stream.
     </itemize>
All these variables are final, so you can not change their values.

<sect2>Miscellaneous variables
<p>
Values of the following variables are used by some predeclared
functions:
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>split_regex</tt>.  The variable value is string which
       represents regular expression which is used by predeclared
       function <tt>split</tt> when the second parameter is not given.
       Initial value of the variable is string <tt>"[ \t]+"</tt>.
     <item><tt>time_format</tt>.  The variable value is string which
       is output format of time used by function <tt>strtime</tt> when
       it is called without parameters.  Initial value of the variable
       is string <tt>"%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y"</tt>.
     </itemize>

<sect1>Predeclared classes
<p>
The most of the predeclared classes describe exceptions which may be
generated in Dino program.

<sect2>File
<p>
Dino has predeclared final class <tt>file</tt>.  Work with files in
Dino program are made through objects of the class.  All declarations
inside of the class are private.  The objects of the class can be
created only by predeclared function <tt>open</tt> or <tt>popen</tt>.
You can not create an object of the class calling the class because
exception <tt>callop</tt> will be generated in this case.

<sect2>Exception classes
<p>
All Dino exceptions are represented by objects of predeclared class
<tt>except</tt> or of an class in the class <tt>except</tt>.  The
class <tt>except</tt> has no parameters therefore all arguments in
call of the class will be ignored.  There is one predeclared class
<tt>error</tt> inside class <tt>except</tt>.  All classes
corresponding user-declared exceptions are suggested to be declared in
class <tt>except</tt> not in the class <tt>error</tt> because all
other exceptions (e.g. generated by Dino interpreter itself or by
predeclared functions) are objects of class <tt>error</tt> or
predeclared classes inside the class <tt>error</tt>. The class
<tt>error</tt> and all classes inside the class has one parameter
<tt>msg</tt> which contains readable message about the exception.  The
following classes are declared in the class <tt>error</tt>:

     <itemize>
     <item><tt>signal</tt>.  Classes inside this class describe
       exceptions by receiving a signal from other OS processes.  They
       are
         <itemize>
         <item><tt>sigint</tt>.  This class describes exception
           generated by user's interrupt from keyboard.
         <item><tt>sigill</tt>.  This class describes exception
           generated by illegal instruction execution.
         <item><tt>sigabrt</tt>.  This class describes exception
           generated by signal abort.
         <item><tt>sigfpe</tt>.  This class describes a floating point
           exception.
         <item><tt>sigterm</tt>.  This class describes exception
           generated by termination signal.
         <item><tt>sigsegv</tt>.  This class describes exception
           generated by an invalid memory reference.
         </itemize>
     <item><tt>invenv</tt>.  This class describes corruption of Dino
       program environment (see predeclared variable <tt>env</tt>).
     <item><tt>invop</tt>.  Classes inside this class describe
       exceptions when operands of operations have incorrect type or
       value.
         <itemize>
         <item><tt>optype</tt>.  This class describes that operand of
           an operation is not of required type (possibly after
           implicit conversions).
         <item><tt>opvalue</tt>.  This class reserved for description
           of that operand of an operation has invalid value.  Now
           this exception is not generated.
         </itemize>
     <item><tt>invindex</tt>.  Classes inside this class describe
       exceptions in referring for a vector element.
         <itemize>
         <item><tt>indextype</tt>.  This class describes that the
           index is not of integer type (possibly after implicit
           integer conversion).
         <item><tt>indexvalue</tt>.  This class describes that the
           index is negative or equal or more than the vector length.
         <item><tt>indexop</tt>.  This class describes that the first
           operand in referring vector element is not vector.
         </itemize>
     <item><tt>invkey</tt>.  Classes inside this class describe
       exceptions in referring for a table element.
         <itemize>
         <item><tt>keyvalue</tt>.  This class describes that there is
           no element in the table with given key when we need value
           of the element.  The exception does not occur when table
           element reference stands in the left hand side of an
           assignment-statement.
         <item><tt>keyop</tt>.  This class describes that the first
           operand in referring table element is not table.
         </itemize>
     <item><tt>invcall</tt>.  Classes inside this class describe
       exceptions in calling functions (mainly predeclared ones).
         <itemize>
         <item><tt>callop</tt>.  This class describes that we try to
           call something which is not function, class, or
           thread-function.  The exception is also generated when you
           try to create a class <tt>file</tt> instance by calling the
           class.
         <item><tt>partype</tt>.  This class describes that a
           parameter value of predeclared function is not of required
           type.
         <item><tt>invresult</tt>.  This class describes that the
           result value of function call is not of required type,
           e.g. comparison function used in call function
           <tt>sort</tt> returns non integer value.
         <item><tt>invinput</tt>.  This class describes that file
           input is not of required format.  Usually the exception is
           generated by function <tt>scan</tt> etc.
         <item><tt>eof</tt>.  This class describes that end of file is
           encountered.  Usually the exception is generated by
           functions reading files (<tt>get</tt>, <tt>scan</tt> etc).
         <item><tt>parnumber</tt>.  This class describes that the
           actual parameters number is not valid when we call a
           predeclared function.
         <item><tt>syserror</tt>.  Classes inside this class describe
           exceptions in predeclared functions which call OS system
           functions.  Some exceptions are never generated but may
             be generated in the future on some OSes.

<sect2>Earley parser classes
<p>
Dino has three following classes which are relative to earley parser
embedded into Dino interpreter.

<sect3>Parser.
<p>
Dino has predeclared final class <tt>parser</tt> which implements
Earley parser.  Earley parser is very powerfull tools to implement
serious language compilers, processors, or translators.  The
implementaion of Earley parser used in Dino has the following
features:

     <itemize>
     <item>It is sufficiently fast and does not require much memory.
       This is the fastest implementation of Earley parser which I
       know.  The main design goal is to achieve speed and memory
       requirements which are necessary to use it in prototype
       compilers and language processors.  It parses 30K lines of C
       program per second on 500 MHz Pentium III and allocates about
       5Mb memory for 10K line C program.
     <item>It makes simple syntax directed translation.  So an
       abstract tree is already the output of Earley parser.
     <item>It can parse input described by an ambiguous grammar.  In
       this case the parse result can be an abstract tree or all
       possible abstract trees.  Moreover it produces the compact
       representation of all possible parse trees by using DAG instead
       of real trees.  These feature can be used to parse natural
       language sentences.
     <item>It can make syntax error recovery.  Moreover its error
       recovery algorithms finds error recovery with minimal number of
       ignored tokens.  It permits to implement parsers with very good
       error recovery and reporting.
     <item>It has fast startup.  There is no practically delay between
       processing grammar and start of parsing.
     <item>It has flexible interface.  The input grammar is given by
       YACC-like description.
     <item>It has good debugging features.  It can print huge amount of
       information about grammar, parsing, error recovery, translation.
       You can even output the result translation in form for a graphic
       visualization program.
     </itemize>
The following public functions and variables are declared in the class
<tt>parser</tt>:
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>ambiguous_p</tt>.  This public variable stores
       information about the last parsing.  Nonzero variable value
       means that during last parsing on given input the parser found
       that the grammar is ambiguous.  The parser find this even if
       you asked producing only one parser tree (see function
       <tt>set_one_parse</tt>).

     <item><tt>set_grammar (descr, strict_p)</tt>.  This function
       tunes the parser to given grammar.  The grammar is given by
       string <tt>descr</tt>.  Nonzero parameter <tt>strict_p</tt>
       value (after implicit integer conversion) means more
       strict checking the grammar.  In this case, all nonterminals
       will be checked on ability to derive a terminal string instead
       of only checking axiom for this.  The function can generate
       exceptions <tt>partype</tt> (if the parameters has wrong types)
       or <tt>invgrammar</tt> if the description is a bad grammar.
       The function also can generate exception <tt>pmemory</tt> if
       there are no memory for internal parser data.

       The description is similiar <em>YACC</em> one.  It has the
       following syntax:
       <tscreen><verb>
          file : file terms [';']
               | file rule
               | terms [';']
               | rule
       
          terms : terms IDENTIFIER ['=' NUMBER]
                | TERM
       
          rule : IDENTIFIER ':' rhs [';']
          
          rhs : rhs '|' sequence [translation]
              | sequence [translation]
          
          sequence :
                   | sequence IDENTIFIER
                   | sequence C_CHARACTER_CONSTANT
          
          translation : ['#'] NUMBER
                      | '#' IDENTIFIER '(' numbers ')'
          
          numbers :
                  | numbers NUMBER
       </verb></tscreen>
       So the description consists of terminal declaration and
       rules sections.
       
       Terminal declaration section describes name of terminals and
       their codes.  Terminal code is optional.  If it is omitted,
       the terminal code will the next free code starting with 256.
       You can declare terminal several times (the single condition
       its code should be the same).
       
       Character constant present in the rules is a terminal
       described by default.  Its code is always code of the
       character constant.
       
       Rules syntax is the same as <em>YACC</em> rule syntax.  The
       single difference is an optional translation construction
       starting with <tt>#</tt> right after each alternative.  The
       translation part could be a single number which means that the
       translation of the alternative will be the translation of the
       symbol with given number (symbol numbers in alternative starts
       with 0).  Or the translation can be abstract node with given
       name and with fields whose values are the translations of the
       alternative symbols with numbers given in parentheses after the
       abstract node name.

       There is reserved terminal <tt>error</tt> which marks start
       point of error recovery.
 
     <item><tt>set_debug (level)</tt>.  This function sets up level of
       debugging information output to <tt>stderr</tt>.  The more
       level, the more information is output.  The default value is 0
       (no output).  The debugging information includes statistics,
       result translation tree, grammar, parser sets, parser sets with
       all situations, situations with contexts.  The function returns
       the previously set up debug level.  Setting up negative debug
       level results in output of translation for program <bf>dot</bf>
       of graphic visualization package <bf>graphviz</bf>.  The
       parameter should be an integer after implicit integer
       conversion.  The function will generate exception
       <tt>partype</tt> if it is not true.
     <item><tt>set_one_parse (flag)</tt>.  This function sets up flag
       whose nonzero value means means building only one translation
       tree (without alternative nodes).  For unambiguous grammar the
       flag does not affect the result.  The function returns the
       previously set up flag value.  The default value of the flag is
       1.  The parameter should be an integer after implicit integer
       conversion.  The function will generate exception
       <tt>partype</tt> if it is not true.
     <item><tt>set_recovery (flag)</tt>.  This function sets up flag
       whose nonzero value means making error recovery if syntax error
       occurred.  Otherwise, syntax error results in finishing parsing
       (although syntax error function passed to <tt>parse</tt> is
       called once).  The function returns the previously set up flag
       value.  The default value of the flag is 1.  The parameter
       should be an integer after implicit integer conversion.  The
       function will generate exception <tt>partype</tt> if it is not
       true.
     <item><tt>set_recovery_match (n_toks)</tt>.  This function sets
       up parser internal parameter meaning how much subsequent tokens
       should be successfully shifted to finish error recovery.  The
       default value is 3.  The function returns the previously set up
       value.  The parameter should be an integer after implicit
       integer conversion.  The function will generate exception
       <tt>partype</tt> if it is not true.

     <item><tt>parse (tokens, error_func)</tt>. This function is major
       function of the class.  It makes translation according to
       previously set up grammar of input given by parameter
       <tt>tokens</tt> whose value should be array of objects of
       predeclared class <tt>token</tt>.  If the parser recognizes a
       syntax error it calls function given through parameter
       <tt>error_func</tt> with six parameters:
          <itemize>
          <item>index of token (in array <tt>tokens</tt>) on which the
            syntax error occured.
          <item>the error token itself.
          <item>index of the first token (in array <tt>tokens</tt>)
            ignored because of error recovery.
          <item>the first ignored token itself.
          <item>index of the first token (in array <tt>tokens</tt>)
            which is not ignored after error recovery.
          <item>the first not ignored token itself.
          </itemize>
       If the parser works with switched off error recovery (see
       function <tt>set_recovery</tt>, the third and fifth parameters
       will be negative and forth and sixth parameters will be
       <bf>nil</bf>.

       The function returns object of predeclared class <tt>anode</tt>
       which is root of the abtsract tree representing the translation
       of the parser input.  The function can generate exception
       <tt>partype</tt> if the parameter types are wrong or
       <tt>invtoken_decl</tt> if the input token has wrong code.  The
       function also can generate exception <tt>pmemory</tt> if there
       are no memory for internal parser data.
     </itemize>

The call of class <tt>parser</tt> itself can generate exception
<tt>pmemory</tt> if there are no memory for internal parser
data.

<sect3>Token.
<p>
Dino has predeclared class <tt>token</tt>.  Objects of this class
should be input of the earley parser (see function <tt>parse</tt> in
class <tt>parser</tt>).  The result abstract tree representing
translation will have input tokens as leaves.  Class <tt>token</tt>
has one public variable <tt>code</tt> whose value should be code of
terminal described in the grammar.  You could extend the class
description e.g. by adding variables whose values could be attributes
of the token (e.g. source line number, name of an identifier, or
value for a number).

<sect3>Anode.
<p>
Dino has predeclared class <tt>anode</tt> whose objects are nodes of
abtract tree representing the translation (see function <tt>parse</tt>
of class <tt>parser</tt>).  Objects of this class are generated by
earley parser.  The class has two public variables <tt>name</tt> whose
value is string representing name of the abstract node as it given in
the grammar and <tt>transl</tt> whose value is array with abstract node
fields as the array elements.  There are a few node types which have
special meaning:

     <itemize>
     <item>Terminal node which has reserved name <tt>$term</tt>.
       Value of public variable <tt>transl</tt> for this node is
       object of class <tt>token</tt> representing the corresponding
       input token which was an element of array passed as parameter
       of function <tt>parse</tt> of function <tt>parser</tt>.
     <item>Error node which has reserved name <tt>$error</tt>.  This
       node exists in one exemplar and represents translation of
       grammar reserved symbol <tt>error</tt>.  The value is public
       variable will be <bf>nil</bf> in this case.
     <item>Empty node which has reserved name <tt>$nil</tt>.  This
       node exists also in one exemplar and represents translation of
       grammar symbol for which we did not describe a translation.
       For example, in a grammar rule an abstract node refers for
       translation of nonterminal for which we do not produce a
       translation.  The value is public variable of such class object
       will be <bf>nil</bf> in this case.
     <item>Alternative node which has reserved name <tt>$alt</tt>.  It
       represents all possible alternatives in translation of grammar
       nonterminal.  The value of public variable <tt>transl</tt> will
       be array with elements whose value are objects of class
       <tt>anode</tt> which represent the all possible translations.
       Such nodes can be generated by the parser only if the grammar
       is ambiguous and we did not asked it to produce only one
       translation.
     </itemize>

<sect3>Example of Earley parser usage.
<p>
Let us write program which transforms expression into postfix polish
form.  Please, read the program comments to understand what the code
do.  The program should output string <tt>"abcda*+*+"</tt> which is
postfix polish form of input string <tt>"a+b*(c+d*a)"</tt>.

<sect1>Predeclared functions
<p>
The predeclared functions expect given number actual parameters (may
be variable number parameters).  If the actual parameter number is
unexpected one, exception <tt>partype</tt> is generated.  The predeclared
functions believe that the actual parameters (may be after implicit
conversions) are of required type.  If it is not true, exception
<tt>partype</tt> is generated.  To show how many parameters the
function requires, we will write names of the parameters and to use
brackets <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> for the optional parameters in
description of the functions.
<p>
        Examples:  The following description
<tscreen><verb>
          strtime ([format [, time]])
</verb></tscreen>
        describes that the function can accept zero, one, or two
        parameters.  If only one parameter is given, then this is
        parameter <tt>format</tt>.
<p>
If something special is not said about the returned result, the
function returns default value <bf>nil</bf>.


<sect2>Mathematical functions
<p>
The following functions make implicit arithmetic conversion of the
parameters.  After the conversions the parameters are expected to be
of integer or floating point type.  The result is always a floating
point number.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>sqrt (x)</tt>.  The function returns the square root of
       <tt>x</tt>.  The function generates exception <tt>edom</tt> if
       <tt>x</tt> is negative.
     <item><tt>exp (x)</tt>.  The function returns <tt>e</tt> (the
       base of natural logarithms) raised to the power of <tt>x</tt>.
     <item><tt>log (x)</tt>.  The function returns the natural
       logarithm of <tt>x</tt>.  The function generates exception
       <tt>edom</tt> if <tt>x</tt> is negative or may generate
       <tt>erange</tt> if the value is zero.
     <item><tt>log10 (x)</tt>.  The function returns the decimal
       logarithm of <tt>x</tt>.  The function generate exception
       <tt>edom</tt> if <tt>x</tt> is negative or may generate
       <tt>erange</tt> if the value is zero.
     <item><tt>pow (x, y)</tt>.  The function returns <tt>x</tt>
       raised to the power of <tt>y</tt>.  The function generates
       exception <tt>edom</tt> if x is negative and y is not integral
       value.
     <item><tt>sin (x)</tt>.  The function returns the sine of
       <tt>x</tt>.
     <item><tt>cos (x)</tt>.  The function returns the cosine of
       <tt>x</tt>.
     <item><tt>atan2 (x, y)</tt>.  The function returns the arc
       tangent of the two variables <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  It is
       similar to calculating the arc tangent of <tt>y / x</tt>,
       except that the signs of both arguments are used to determine
       the quadrant of the result.
     </itemize>

<sect2>Pattern matching functions
<p>
Dino has predeclared functions which are used for <em>pattern
matching</em>.  The pattern is described by <em>regular
expressions</em> (<em>regex</em>).  The pattern has syntax of
<em>extended</em> POSIX (1003.2) regular expression, i.e. the pattern
has the following syntax:
<tscreen><verb>
          Regex = Branch {"|" Branch}
</verb></tscreen>
A regex matches anything that matches one of the <em>branches</em>.
<tscreen><verb>
          Branch = {Piece}
</verb></tscreen>
A branch matches a match for the first <em>piece</em>, followed by a
match for the second piece, etc.  If the pieces are omitted, the
branch matches the null string.
<tscreen><verb>
          Piece = Atom ("*" | "+" | "?" | Bound)

          Bound = "{" Min ["," [Max]] "}"

          Min = <unsigned integer between 0 and 255 inclusive>

          Max = <unsigned integer between 0 and 255 inclusive>
</verb></tscreen>
An <em>atom</em> followed by <tt>*</tt> matches a sequence of 0 or
more matches of the atom.  An atom followed by <tt>+</tt> matches a
sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom.  An atom followed by
<tt>?</tt> matches a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom.
<p>
There is more general construction (a <em>bound</em>) for describing
repetitions of atom.  An atom followed by a bound containing only one
integer <tt>min</tt> matches a sequence of exactly <tt>min</tt>
matches of the atom.  An atom followed by a bound containing one
integer <tt>min</tt> and a comma matches a sequence of <tt>min</tt> or
more matches of the atom.  An atom followed by a bound containing two
integers <tt>min</tt> and <tt>max</tt> matches a sequence of
<tt>min</tt> through <tt>max</tt> (inclusive) matches of the atom.
<tscreen><verb>
          Atom = "(" Regex ")"
               | "(" ")"
               | "."
               | "^"
               | "$"
               | BracketedList
               | "\^"
               | "\["
               | "\$"
               | "\("
               | "\)"
               | "\*"
               | "\+"
               | "\?"
               | "\{"
               | <any pair the first character is \ and the second is any
                  except for ^.[$()|*+? >
               | <any character except for ^.[$()|*+? >
</verb></tscreen>
Regular expression enclosed in <tt>()</tt> can be an atom.  In this
case it matches a match for the regular expression in the
parentheses), an atom <tt>()</tt> matches the null string.  Atom
<tt>.</tt> matches any single character.  Atoms <tt>^</tt> and
<tt>$</tt> match correspondingly the null string at the beginning of a
line and the null string at the end of a line.
<p>
Atom which is <tt>\</tt> followed by one of the characters
<tt>^.[$()|*+?{\</tt> matches that character taken as an ordinary
character.  Atom which is <tt>\</tt> followed by any other character
matches the second character taken as an ordinary character, as if the
<tt>\</tt> had not been present.  So you should use <tt>\\</tt> for
matching with single <tt>\</tt>.  An atom which is any other single
character matches that character.  It is illegal to end an regular
expression with <tt>\</tt>.  There is an exception which is not
described by the atom syntax.  A <tt>{</tt> followed by a character
other than a digit is an ordinary character not the beginning of a
bound and matches character <tt>{</tt>.
<tscreen><verb>
          BracketedList = "[" List "]"

          List = FirstChar ["-" Char] {Char ["-" Char]}

          FirstChar = <any character except for ^ - and ]>
                    | CollatingElement

          Char = FirstChar
               | "^"

          CollatingElement = "[:" Class ":]"

          Class = "alnum"
                | "alpha"
                | "blank"
                | "ctrl"
                | "digit"
                | "graph"
                | "lower"
                | "print"
                | "punct"
                | "space"
                | "upper"
                | "xdigit"
</verb></tscreen>
An atom can be a bracket expression which is a <em>list</em> of
characters enclosed in <tt>[]</tt>.  Usually it is used to match
practically any single character from the list.  If the list begins
with <tt>^</tt>, it matches any single character (but see below) not
from the rest of the list.  If two characters in the list are
separated by <tt>-</tt>, this is shorthand for the full <em>range</em>
of characters between those two (inclusive) in the collating sequence
of ASCII codes, e.g. <tt>[0-9]</tt> matches any decimal digit.  It is
illegal for two ranges to share an <em>endpoint</em>,
e.g. <tt>a-c-e</tt>.
<p>
There are exceptions which are not described by the atom syntax which
is used to include a literal <tt>]</tt> in the list: make it the first
character (following a possible <tt>^</tt>).  To include a literal
<tt>-</tt>, make it the first or the last character, or the second
endpoint of a range.  As you can see from the syntax, all special
characters (except for <tt>[</tt>) described in atom lose their
special significance within a bracket expression.
<p>
Collating element is a name of a character class enclosed in
<tt>[:</tt> and <tt>:]</tt>.  It denotes the list of all characters
belonging to that class.  Standard character class names are:
<tscreen><verb>
       alnum       digit       punct
       alpha       graph       space
       blank       lower       upper
       cntrl       print       xdigit
</verb></tscreen>
These names stand for the character classes defined in ANSI C include
file <tt>ctype.h</tt>.  There is an exception not described by the
syntax: a character class can not be used as an endpoint of a range.
<p>
There is an extension in regular expressions used by DINO and in ones
defined in Posix 1003.2: no particular limit is imposed on the length
of the regular expression.
<p>
There are the following Dino pattern matching functions:
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>match (regex, string)</tt>.  The function searches for
       matching regular expression <tt>regex</tt> in <tt>string</tt>.
       The both parameters should be strings after their implicit
       string conversion.  The matching is made according to standard
       POSIX 1003.2: The regular expression matches the substring
       starting earliest in the string.  If the regular expression
       could match more than one substring starting at that point, it
       matches the longest.  Subexpressions also match the longest
       possible substrings, subject to the constraint that the whole
       match be as long as possible, with subexpressions starting
       earlier in the regular expression taking priority over ones
       starting later.  In other words higher-level subexpressions
       take priority over their lower-level component subexpressions.
       Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating
       elements.  A null string is considered longer than no match at
       all.  If there is no matching, the function returns value
       <bf>nil</bf>.  Otherwise, the function returns new mutable
       vector of integers.  The length of the vector is <tt>2 * (N +
       1)</tt> where <tt>N</tt> is number of atoms which are regular
       expressions in parentheses.  The first two elements are index
       of the first character of substring corresponding to all
       regular expression and index of the last character plus one.
       The subsequent two elements are index of the first character of
       substring corresponding to the first atom in the regular
       expression (the atoms are ordered by their open parentheses)
       and index of the last character plus one.  And so on.  If there
       is no matching with a regular expression in parentheses, the
       corresponding vector elements will have negative values.
       <p>
       Example: The program
<tscreen><verb>
          println (match ("()(a)((a)(a))", "baaab"));
</verb></tscreen>
       outputs
<tscreen><verb>
          [1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4]
</verb></tscreen>
     <item><tt>gmatch (regex, string[, flag])</tt>.  The function
       searches for different occurrences of regular expression
       <tt>regex</tt> in <tt>string</tt>.  The both parameters should
       be strings after their implicit string conversion.  The third
       parameter is optional.  If it is present, it should be integer
       after implicit integer conversion.  If its value is nonzero,
       the substrings matched by regexp can be overlapped.  Otherwise,
       the substrings are never overlapped.  If the parameter is
       absent, the function behaves as its value were zero.  The
       function returns a new mutable vector of integers.  The length
       of the vector is <tt>2 * N</tt> where <tt>N</tt> is number of
       the found occurrences.  Pairs of the vector elements correspond
       to the occurrences.  The first element of the pairs is index of
       the first character of substring corresponding to all regular
       expression in the corresponding occurrences and the second
       element is index of the last character plus one.  If there is
       no one occurrence, the function returns <bf>nil</bf>.
       <p>
       Example: The program
<tscreen><verb>
          println (gmatch ("aa", "aaaaa"));
          println (gmatch ("aa", "aaaaa", 1));
</verb></tscreen>
       outputs
<tscreen><verb>
          [0, 2, 2, 4]
          [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]
</verb></tscreen>
     <item><tt>sub (regex, string, subst)</tt>.  The function searches
       for matching regular expression <tt>regex</tt> in
       <tt>string</tt>.  The all parameters should be string after
       their implicit string conversion.  If there is no matching, the
       function returns value <bf>nil</bf>.  Otherwise, the function
       returns new mutable vector of characters in which the matched
       substring has been changed by string <tt>subst</tt>.  Within
       the replacement string <tt>subst</tt>, the sequence
       <tt>\n</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is a digit from 1 to 9, may be
       used to indicate just the text that matched the <tt>n</tt>'th
       atom of the regex in parentheses.  The sequence <tt>\0</tt>
       represents the entire matched text, as does the character
       <tt>&</tt>.
     <item><tt>gsub (regex, string, subst)</tt>.  The function is
       analogous to function <tt>sub</tt> except for the function
       searches for all non-overlapped substrings matched with the
       regular expression and returns new mutable vector of characters
       in which all matched substrings have been changed by string
       <tt>subst</tt>.
     <item><tt>split (string [, regex])</tt>.  The function splits
       <tt>string</tt> onto non-overlapped substrings separated by
       strings matched with the regular expression.  The all
       parameters should be strings after their implicit string
       conversion.  If the second parameter is omitted the value of
       predeclared variable <tt>split_regex</tt> is used instead of
       the second parameter value.  In this case the function may
       generate exception <tt>invenvar</tt> (corrupted value of a
       predeclared variable).  The function returns new mutable vector
       with elements which are the separated substrings.  If the
       regular expression is null string, the function returns new
       mutable vector with elements which are strings each containing
       one character of the string parameter.  <p> Examples: The
       program
<tscreen><verb>
          println (split ("aaa bbb ccc	ddd"));
</verb></tscreen>
       outputs
<tscreen><verb>
          ["aaa", "bbb", "ccc", "ddd"]
</verb></tscreen>
       The program
<tscreen><verb>
          println (split ("abcdef", ""));
</verb></tscreen>
       outputs
<tscreen><verb>
          ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
</verb></tscreen>
     </itemize>
If the regular expression is incorrect, the functions generates one of
the following predeclared exceptions (see predeclared classes):
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>ebrack</tt>.  Regular expression has unmatched bracket.
     <item><tt>erange</tt>.  Invalid use of range in regular
       expression.
     <item><tt>ectype</tt>.  Unknown character class name in regular
       expression.
     <item><tt>eparen</tt>.  Regular expression has unmatched
       parenthesis.
     <item><tt>esubreg</tt>.  Invalid back reference to a
       subexpression in regular expression.
     <item><tt>eend</tt>.  Non specific error in regular expression.
     <item><tt>eescape</tt>.  Invalid escape sequence in regex.
     <item><tt>ebadpat</tt>.  Invalid use of pattern operators in
       regular expression.
     <item><tt>esize</tt>.  Compiled regular expression is too big.
     <item><tt>espace</tt>.  No memory for regular expression function
       work.
     </itemize>

<sect2>File functions
<p>
Dino has some predeclared functions working on files and
directories.

<sect3>Functions for access to file/directory information
<p>
The following predeclared functions can be used for reading file or
directory information.  The functions may generate an exception
declared in class syserror (e.g. <tt>eaccess</tt>,
<tt>enametoolong</tt>, <tt>enfile</tt> and so on) besides standard
<tt>partype</tt>, <tt>parnumber</tt>.  The functions expect one
parameter which should be a file instance (see predeclared class
<tt>file</tt>) or path name of a file represented by a string (the
functions makes implicit string conversion of the parameter).  The
single exception is <tt>isatty</tt> which expect only a file instance.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>ftype (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  The function
       returns one the following characters:
       <itemize>
       <item><tt>'f'</tt>.  A regular file.
       <item><tt>'d'</tt>.  A directory.
       <item><tt>'L'</tt>.  A symbolic link.
       <item><tt>'c'</tt>.  A character device.
       <item><tt>'b'</tt>.  A block device.
       <item><tt>'p'</tt>.  A fifo.
       <item><tt>'S'</tt>.  A socket.
       </itemize>
       Under some OSes the function never returns some of the
       characters (e.g. 'c' or 'b').
     <item><tt>fun (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  The function
       returns new string representing name of owner of the file
       (directory).  Under some OSes the function may return new
       string <tt>"Unknown"</tt> if there is no notion "owner" in the
       OS file system.
     <item><tt>fgn (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  Analogous to the
       previous function except for it returns new string representing
       name of group of the file (directory).  Under some OSes the
       function may return new string <tt>"Unknown"</tt> if there is
       no notion "group" in the OS file system.
     <item><tt>fsize (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  The function
       returns integer value which is the length in bytes of the file.
     <item><tt>fatime (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  The function
       returns integer value which is time of the last access to the
       file (directory).  The time is measured in seconds since the
       fixed time (usually since January 1, 1970).  See also <em>time
       functions</em>.
     <item><tt>fmtime (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  Analogous to the
       previous functions but returns time of the last modification.
     <item><tt>fctime (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  Analogous to the
       previous functions but returns time of the last change.  Here
       the change means usually changing file attributes (owner, modes
       and so on), the modification means usually changing the file
       itself.
     <item><tt>fumode (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  The function
       returns new string representing rights of owner of the file
       (directory).  The string may contain the following characters
       (in the same order if the string contains more one character):
       <itemize>
       <item><tt>'s'</tt>.  Sticky bit of the file (directory).
       <item><tt>'r'</tt>.  Right to read.
       <item><tt>'w'</tt>.  Right to write.
       <item><tt>'x'</tt>.  Right to execute.
       </itemize>
     <item><tt>fgmode (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  Analogous to the
       previous function except for that it returns information about
       the file (directory) group users rights and that the function
       never returns a string containing character <tt>'s'</tt>.
     <item><tt>fomode (fileinstance_or_filename)</tt>.  Analogous to the
       previous function except for that it returns information about
       rights of all other users.
     <item><tt>isatty (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function returns 1 if
       a file instance given as parameter is an open file connected to
       a terminal and 0 else.
     </itemize>
The following function can be used to change rights of the file
(directory) for different users.  The function expects two strings
(after implicit string conversions).  The first one is path name of a
file (directory).  The second one is rights.  If the string contains a
character 'r', this is right to read (see characters used to denote
different rights in description of function <tt>fumod</tt>).  The
functions always return value <bf>nil</bf>.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>chumod (path, mode)</tt>.  The function sets up rights
       for the file (directory) owner according to given mode.
     <item><tt>chgmod (path, mode)</tt>.  Analogous to the previous
       function except for that it sets up rights for the file
       (directory) group users and that the function ignores character
       <tt>'s'</tt>.
     <item><tt>chomod (path, mode)</tt>.  Analogous to the previous
       function except for that it sets up rights for all other users.
     </itemize>

<sect3>Functions for work with directories
<p>
The following functions work with directories.  The functions may
generate an exception declared in class syserror
(e.g. <tt>eaccess</tt>, <tt>enametoolong</tt>, <tt>enotdir</tt> and so
on) besides standard <tt>partype</tt>, <tt>parnumber</tt>.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>readdir (dirpath)</tt>.  The function makes implicit
       string conversion of the parameter value which should be a
       string (directory path).  The function returns new mutable
       vector with elements which are strings representing names of
       all files and sub-directories (including <tt>"."</tt> and
       <tt>".."</tt> for the current and parent directory
       respectively) in given directory.
     <item><tt>mkdir (dirpath)</tt>.  The function creates directory
       with given name represented by a string (the parameter value
       after implicit string conversion).  The directory has
       read/write/execute rights for all.  You can change it with the
       aid of functions <tt>ch*mod</tt>.
     <item><tt>rmdir (dirpath)</tt>.  The function returns the
       directory given by a string which is parameter value after
       implicit string conversion.
     <item><tt>getcwd ()</tt>.  The function returns new string
       representing full path of the current directory.
     <item><tt>chdir (dirpath)</tt>.  The function makes the directory
       given by a string (which is parameter value after implicit
       string conversion) the current directory.

<p>
The following functions (besides input/output functions) work with OS
files.  The functions may generate an exception declared in class
syserror (e.g. <tt>eaccess</tt>, <tt>enametoolong</tt>,
<tt>eisdir</tt> and so on) besides standard <tt>partype</tt>,
<tt>parnumber</tt>.  The function <tt>rename</tt> can be used for
renaming a directory besides files.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>rename (old_path, new_path)</tt>.  The function renames
       file (directory) given by its path name.  The old and new names
       are given by parameter values which should be strings after
       implicit string conversions.
     <item><tt>remove (file_path)</tt>.  The function removes OS file
       given by its path name.  The file path name should be a string
       after implicit string conversion.
     <item><tt>open (file_path, mode)</tt>.  The function opens the
       file for work in given <em>mode</em>, creates new class
       <tt>file</tt> instance, associates the opened file to the
       instance, and returns the instance.  The parameter values
       should be strings after implicit string conversions.  The first
       parameter value is string representing the file path.  The
       second parameter value is string representing mode for work
       with the file (see all possible modes in ANSI C function
       <tt>fopen</tt> documentation).  All work with an opened file
       is made through the file instance.
     <item><tt>close (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function closes file
       opened by function <tt>open</tt>.  The file is given by class
       <tt>file</tt> instance.  The function also removes association
       of the instance with the file.
     <item><tt>flush (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function flushes any
       output that has been buffered for the opened file given by
       class <tt>file</tt> instance.
     <item><tt>popen (command, mode)</tt>.  The function starts shell
       command line given by the first parameter value (which should
       be a string after implicit string conversion), creates a pipe,
       creates new class <tt>file</tt> instance, associates the pipe
       with the instance, and return the instance.  Writing to such
       pipe (through the class file instance) writes to the standard
       input of the command.  Conversely, reading from the pipe reads
       the command's standard output.  After implicit string
       conversion the second parameter value should be string "r" (for
       reading from the pipe) or "w" (for writing to the pipe).  The
       pipe should be closed by function <tt>pclose</tt>.
     <item><tt>pclose (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function waits for the
       command connected to a pipe to terminate.  The pipe is given by
       class <tt>file</tt> instance returned by function
       <tt>popen</tt>.  The function also removes association of the
       instance with the pipe.
     <item><tt>tell (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function returns the
       current value of the file position indicator for the file
       (opened by function <tt>open</tt>) given by class <tt>file</tt>
       instance.
     <item><tt>seek (fileinstance, offset, whence)</tt>.  The function
       sets up the current file position indicator for the file
       (opened by function <tt>open</tt>) given by class <tt>file</tt>
       instance.  The position is given by <tt>offset</tt> which
       should be an integer after implicit arithmetic conversion and
       <tt>whence</tt> which should be a string after implicit string
       conversion.  The first character of the string should be
       <tt>'s'</tt>, <tt>'c'</tt>, or <tt>'e'</tt> (these characters
       mean that the offset is relative to the start of the file, the
       current position indicator, or end-of-file, respectively).
     </itemize>

<sect3>File output functions
<p>
The following functions are used to output something into opened
files.  All the functions return always value <bf>nil</bf>.  The
functions may generate an exception declared in class syserror
(e.g. <tt>eio</tt>, <tt>enospc</tt> and so on) besides standard
<tt>partype</tt>, <tt>parnumber</tt>.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>put (...)</tt>.  All parameters should be strings after
       implicit string conversions.  The function outputs all strings
       into standard output stream.
     <item><tt>putln (...)</tt>.  The function is analogous to
       function <tt>put</tt> except for that it additionally outputs
       new line character after output of all the strings.
     <item><tt>fput (fileinstance, ...)</tt>.  The function is
       analogous to function <tt>put</tt> except for that it outputs
       the string into opened file associated with class <tt>file</tt>
       instance which is the first parameter value.
     <item><tt>fputln (fileinstance, ...)</tt>.  The function is
       analogous to function <tt>fput</tt> except for that it
       additionally outputs new line character after output of all the
       strings.
     <item><tt>print (...)</tt>.  The function outputs all parameter
       values into standard output stream.  The function never makes
       implicit conversions of the parameter values.  The parameter
       values are output as they could be represented in Dino itself
       (e.g. character <tt>'c'</tt> is output as <tt>'c'</tt>, vector
       <tt>['a', 'b', 'c']</tt> is output as <tt>"abc"</tt>, vector
       <tt>[10, 20]</tt> as <tt>[10, 20]</tt> and so on).  As you know
       some values (functions, classes, block instances, class
       instances, threads) are not represented fully in DINO.  Such
       values are represented schematically.  For example, output
       <tt>func f {}.g(unique_number)</tt> means function <tt>f</tt>
       in call of function (or class) <tt>g</tt> with given unique
       number and function g is in instance of the implicit block
       covering all program.  For the function <tt>g</tt>, output
       would look like simply <tt>func g</tt> because there is only
       one instance of the implicit block covering all program.
       Output for instance of class <tt>c</tt> in function <tt>f</tt>
       looks like <tt>instance {}.f(unique_number).c(unique_number)</tt>.
       Output for block instance of function <tt>f</tt> looks like
       <tt>stack {}.f(unique_number)</tt>.  Output for thread whose
       thread-function <tt>t</tt> is declared in function <tt>f</tt>
       looks like <tt>thread unique_number {}.f(unique_number).t(unique_number)</tt>.
     <item><tt>println (...)</tt>.  The function is analogous to
       function <tt>print</tt> except for that it additionally outputs
       new line character after output of all parameters.
     <item><tt>fprint (fileinstance, ...)</tt>.  The function is
       analogous to function <tt>print</tt> except for that it outputs
       the parameters into opened file associated with class
       <tt>file</tt> instance which is the first parameter value.
     <item><tt>fprintln (fileinstance, ...)</tt>.  The function is
       analogous to function <tt>fprint</tt> except for that it
       additionally outputs new line character after output of all the
       output parameters.
     </itemize>

<sect3>File input functions
<p>
The following functions are used to input something from opened files.
All the functions return always value <bf>nil</bf>.  The functions may
generate an exception declared in class syserror (e.g. <tt>eio</tt>,
<tt>enospc</tt> and so on) and <tt>eof</tt> besides standard
<tt>partype</tt>, <tt>parnumber</tt>.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>get ()</tt>.  The function reads one character from
       standard input stream and returns it.  The functions generates
       exception <tt>eof</tt> if the function tries to read the end of
       file.
     <item><tt>getln ()</tt>.  The function reads one line from standard
       input stream and returns it as new string.  The end of line is
       character newline or end of file.  The returned string does not
       contain the newline character.  The function generates
       exception <tt>eof</tt> only when the file position indicator
       before the function call stands exactly on the end of file.
     <item><tt>getf ()</tt>.  The function reads all standard input
       stream and returns it as new string.  The returned string does
       not contain the newline character.  The function generates
       exception <tt>eof</tt> only when the file position indicator
       before the function call stands exactly on the end of file.
     <item><tt>fget (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function is analogous to
       function <tt>get</tt> except for that it reads from opened file
       associated with class <tt>file</tt> instance which is the
       parameter value.
     <item><tt>fgetln (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function is analogous to
       function <tt>getln</tt> except for that it reads from opened
       file associated with class <tt>file</tt> instance which is the
       parameter value.
     <item><tt>fgetf (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function is analogous
       to function <tt>getf</tt> except for that it reads from opened
       file associated with class <tt>file</tt> instance which is the
       parameter value.
     <item><tt>scan ()</tt>.  The functions reads character, integer,
       floating point number, string, vector, or table and returns it
       as the result.  The input values should be represented in the
       file as ones in Dino language (except for that there should be
       no identifiers in the input values and there should be no
       operators in the values.  Although sign <tt>+</tt> and
       <tt>-</tt> is possible in integer or floating point
       represenation).  The table or vector should contains only
       values of types mentioned above.  The values in the file can be
       separated by white characters.  If there is error
       (e.g. unbalanced brackets in a vector value) in read value
       representation the function generates exception
       <tt>invinput</tt>.  The functions generates exception
       <tt>eof</tt> if only white characters are unread in the file.
     <item><tt>scanln ()</tt>.  The function is analogous to function
       <tt>scan</tt> except for that it skips all characters until end
       of line or end of file after reading the value.  Skipping is
       made even if the exception <tt>invinput</tt> is generated.
     <item><tt>fscan (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function is analogous
       to function <tt>scan</tt> except for that it reads from opened
       file associated with class <tt>file</tt> instance which is the
       parameter value.
     <item><tt>fscanln (fileinstance)</tt>.  The function is analogous
       to function <tt>scanln</tt> except for that it reads from
       opened file associated with class <tt>file</tt> instance which
       is the parameter value.
     </itemize>

<sect2>Time functions
<p>
The following functions can be used to get information about real
time.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>time ()</tt>.  The function returns time in seconds
       since the fixed time (usually since January 1, 1970).
     <item><tt>strtime ([format [, time]])</tt>.  The function returns
       string representing <tt>time</tt> (integer representing time in
       seconds since the fixed time) according to <tt>format</tt>
       (string).  If the format is not given, the value of variable
       <tt>time_format</tt> is used.  In this case if
       <tt>time_format</tt> value is corrupted, the function generates
       exception <tt>invenvar</tt>.  If the time is not given, the
       current time is used.  The format is the same as in C library
       function <tt>strftime</tt>.  Here the extraction from the
       function documentation.  The following format specifier can be
       used in the format.
         <itemize>

         </itemize>
     </itemize>

<sect2>Functions for access to process information
<p>
There are Dino predeclared functions which are used to get information
about the current OS process (Dino interpreter which executes the
program).  Each OS processor has unique identifier and usually OS
processes are called by a concrete user and group and are executed on
behalf of the concrete user and group (so called effective
identifiers).  The following functions return such information.  On
some OSes the function may return string "Unknown" as a name if there
are notion of user and group identifiers.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>getpid ()</tt>.  The function returns integer value
       which is process ID of the current OS process.
     <item><tt>getun ()</tt>.  The function returns new string which
       is user name for the current OS process.
     <item><tt>geteun ()</tt>.  The function returns new string which
       is effective user name for the current OS process.
     <item><tt>getgn ()</tt>.  The function returns new string which
       is group name for the current OS process.
     <item><tt>getegn ()</tt>.  The function returns new string which
       is effective group name for the current OS process.
     <item><tt>getgroups ()</tt>.  The function returns new vector of
       strings (possibly empty vector) representing supplementary
       group names for the current OS process.
     </itemize>

<sect2>Miscellaneous functions
<p>
There are the following miscellaneous functions.
     <itemize>
     <item><tt>max (v1, v2, ...)</tt>.  The function searches for and
       returns maximal value between all parameters.  The parameters
       should be of integer or floating point type after implicit
       arithmetic conversions.  So the function can return integer or
       floating point number depending from the type of maximal value
       after the conversion.
     <item><tt>min (v1, v2, ...)</tt>.  The function is analogous to
       the previous function but searches for and returns the minimal
       value.
     <item><tt>tolower (str)</tt>.  The function expects that
       parameter <tt>str</tt> (after implicit string conversion) is
       a string.  The function returns new string <tt>str</tt> in which
       upper case letters changed by the corresponding lower case
       letters.
     <item><tt>toupper (str)</tt>.  The function expects that
       parameter <tt>str</tt> (after implicit string conversion) is
       a string.  The function returns new string <tt>str</tt> in which
       lower case letters changed by the corresponding upper case
       letters.
     <item><tt>eltype (vect)</tt>.  The function expects that the
       parameter value is a vector.  The function returns <bf>nil</bf>
       if the vector is heterogenous, otherwise the function returns
       type of the vector elements (type of <bf>nil</bf> if the vector
       is empty).
     <item><tt>keys (tab)</tt>.  The function expects that the
       parameter value is a table.  The function returns new mutable
       vector containing all keys of the table.  The order of keys in
       the vector is undefined.
     <item><tt>context (par)</tt>. The function returns context (see
       section <em>Declarations and Scope Rules</em>) represented by a
       block instance or an object for given parameter value which
       should be a function, a class, a thread, a block instance, or
       an object.
     <item><tt>inside (par1, par2[, flag])</tt>.  The function usage
       goal is to check that something declared inside something
       other.  If the third parameter value after implicit integer
       conversion is given and nonzero, it is checked with taking
       contexts into account.  The second parameter value should be a
       function or a class.  The first parameter value should be a
       function, a class, an object, or a block instance.  In the last
       three cases, they defines corresponding function, class, block.
       If the function, class, block defined by the first parameter is
       declared inside function or class given by the second
       parameter, the function <tt>inside</tt> returns 1.  The
       function <tt>inside</tt> returns 1 also if function or class
       defined by the first parameter is the same as the function or
       class given by the second parameter.  Otherwise the function
       <tt>inside</tt> returns 0.  The following example illustrates
       the difference between checking with taking contexts into
       account and without it.
<tscreen><verb>
          class c () {
            class subc () {
            }
          }
          inside (c ().subc (), c ().subc);
          inside (c ().subc (), c ().subc, 1);
</verb></tscreen>
       The first call of <tt>inside</tt> returns 1, the second one
       returns 0.
     <item><tt>subv (vect, index[, length])</tt>.  The function is
       used to extract a slice of vector elements.  The first
       parameter value should be a vector after implicit string
       conversion.  The second and the third parameter values should
       be integers after implicit integer conversion. The function
       extracts only element or part of the slice existing in the
       vector (so you can use any values of the index and the length).
       If index is negative, it is considered to be equal to zero.  If
       the length is negative, the slice will finish on the vector
       end.  The function returns new vector which is the slice.  The
       result vector is immutable only when the original vector is
       immutable.
     <item><tt>del (vect, index[, length]) or del (tab, key)</tt>.
       The first form of the function is used to remove the vector
       element or the slice of vector elements from the mutable
       vector.  The second and the third parameter values should be
       integers after implicit integer conversion. The function
       removes only element or part of the slice existing in the
       vector (so you can use any values of the index and the length).
       If index is negative, it is considered to be equal to zero.  If
       the length is negative, the slice will finish on the vector
       end.  The second form of the function is used to remove the
       element (if any) with given key from the mutable table.  The
       function generates exception <tt>immutable</tt> if we are
       trying to remove from an immutable vector or table.  The
       function returns the modified vector.
     <item><tt>ins (vect, el[, index])</tt>.  The function inserts
       element given by the second parameter into the vector given by
       the first parameter on the place given by the third parameter.
       If the third parameter is not given it is believed to be zero.
       The third parameter should be an integer after implicit integer
       conversion.  If the third parameter is negative or equal or
       greater than the vector length, the element is inserted at the
       end of the vector.  The function generates exception
       <tt>immutable</tt> if we are trying to insert into an immutable
       vector.  The function returns the modified vector.
     <item><tt>insv (vect, vect[, index])</tt>.  The function is
       analogous to the function <tt>ins</tt> but it is used for
       insertion of all vector elements into the vector given as the
       first parameter.  So the second parameter value should be a
       vector.  The function returns the modified vector.
     <item><tt>rev (vect)</tt>.  The function reverses given vector.
       The function generates exception <tt>immutable</tt> if we are
       trying to reverse an immutable vector.  The function returns
       the modified vector.
     <item><tt>cmpv (vect, vect)</tt>.  The function makes implicit
       string conversion of the parameter values.  After that, the
       parameter values should be vectors whose the first
       corresponding equal elements should have the same type
       (character, integer, or floating point type).  The first
       corresponding unequal elements should have the same type too
       (the remaining elements can have different type).  As usually
       if this is not true, exception <tt>partype</tt> is generated.
       The function returns 1 if the first unequal element value of
       the first vector is greater than the corresponding element in
       the second vector, -1 if less, and 0 if the all vector elements
       are equal.  If the first vector is a prefix of the second
       vector, the function returns -1.  If the second vector is a
       prefix of the first vector, the function returns 1.  So it is
       generalized lexicographical order.
     <item><tt>sort (vect[, compare_function])</tt>.  The function
       returns new sorted vector.  The original vector given as the
       first parameter value should be a homogeneous vector whose
       elements are of character, integer, or floating point type.  If
       the second parameter is not given, standard arithmetic order
       (see comparison operators) is used.  To use special ordering,
       use the second parameter which should be a function which
       compares two elements of the vector and returns negative
       integer if the first parameter value (element) is less than the
       second one, positive integer if the first parameter value is
       greater than the second one, and zero if they are equal.
     <item><tt>exit (code)</tt>.  The function finishes work of the
       interpreter with given code which should be integer value after
       implicit integer conversion.
     <item><tt>gc ()</tt>.  The function forces garbage collection
       with heap compaction.  Usually Dino interpreter itself calls
       garbage collection when there are no more free memory.
     <item><tt>system (command)</tt>.  The function executes command
       given by a string (the parameter value) in OS command
       interpreter.  Besides standard exceptions <tt>parnumber</tt>
       and <tt>partype</tt> the function may generate exceptions
       <tt>noshell</tt> and <tt>systemfail</tt>.
     <item><tt>srand ([seed])</tt>.  The function sets the parameter
       value (after implicit integer conversion) as the seed for a new
       sequence of pseudo-random integers to be returned by
       <tt>rand</tt>.  These sequences are repeatable by calling
       <tt>srand</tt> with the same seed value.  If the parameter is
       not given, the seed will be the result of calling function
       <tt>time</tt>.
     <item><tt>rand ()</tt>.  The function returns a pseudo-random
       integer value.  If the function <tt>srand</tt> is not called
       before, 1 will be used as the seed value.
