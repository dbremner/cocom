  COCOM has been ported into Win32 environment.  You can translate it
by Microsoft VC++ 6.0.  To make this, open workplace in the uppest
subdirectory `cocom', choose `cocom' as active project, choose Debug
or Release version, and make Build `cocom.exe'.  The project cocom
contains all projects for building all COCOM components.  After
building, all binary and library files will be in the uppest
sub-directory `bin', all object files in sub-directories with names of
COCOM components (msta, oka, etc) of the uppest subdirectory `obj'.
You can move all COCOM components (placed in the sub-directory `bin')
in the any place convenient for you.  In order to process yacc files,
the COCOM sources has already Win32 yacc utility.  You do not need any
manipulation for yacc program.

  Because VC++ 6.0 has incomplete implementation of C++ templates.
This port does not support template classes of packages `arithm' and
`IEEE'.

  If you do not need modify sources of COCOM, the better way of COCOM
installation is to use install package prepared by InstallShield.  You
can find the package on the same COCOM web site.

  You can also use for building COCOM the package cygwin
(http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin) as it described in file INSTALL.
